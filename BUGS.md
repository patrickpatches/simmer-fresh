# BUGS.md — Session Bug Cache

> This file is the session-level cache of all known bugs, synced from GitHub Issues at the start of each session.
> Source of truth: GitHub Issues at https://github.com/patrickpatches/hone/issues
> Status flow: OPEN → FIX ATTEMPTED → VALIDATED ✅ (by Patrick) or REJECTED 🔴 (reopened)
> Rule: never self-close. Status only moves to VALIDATED when Patrick confirms on-device.

| REGN-001 | Recipe cards misalign after first scroll | FIX ATTEMPTED | Commit `1fca0aaa3d3d` — awaiting Patrick on-device validation |
| REGN-006 | Equipment + Prep sections missing on most recipes | FIX ATTEMPTED | UI rendering restored 7 May 2026 — awaiting on-device validation |
| REGN-007 | Pantry STILL NEED chip state broken (undo, X-removal, ✓-toggle) | FIX ATTEMPTED | Refactored to derive state from shopping list — awaiting on-device validation |

**REGN-006 root cause (diagnosed 7 May 2026):**
- Patrick reported Equipment + Mise en place sections missing across most recipes (not just SMASH_BURGER).
- True root cause: regression in `mobile/app/recipe/[id].tsx`. Working tree had 1097 lines vs HEAD's 1540 — a previous edit dropped the entire DECISION-008 UI block (At a glance, What to know, Equipment, Prep/Mise, Finishing & tasting, Leftovers & storage). The data was in the schema, in seed-recipes.ts (for the 6 Batch 1 recipes), and in SQLite — but the UI had no `recipe.equipment.map(...)` block to render it. So the bug was 100% UI-side.
- Fix: restored HEAD's full DECISION-008 rendering. Re-applied Pressable+View split on header buttons (back, plan toggle, heart), title-card pill, Watch link, expand-more chip, and MiseItem itself per the session-4 Report-4 lesson — Android silently drops layout/visual props from `style={({ pressed }) => ({…})}`. UI label changed "Mise en place" → "Prep" per Patrick 7 May; schema field stays `mise_en_place`.

**REGN-006 audit table — populated state of every recipe:**

The DECISION-008 fields are: `equipment[]`, `before_you_start[]`, `mise_en_place[]`, `finishing_note`, `leftovers_note`, `total_time_minutes`, `active_time_minutes`.

| Status | Count | Recipes |
|---|---|---|
| ✅ Populated (Batch 1) | 6 | chicken-schnitzel, chicken-vegetable-stir-fry, beef-lasagne, roast-lamb-rosemary-garlic, fish-and-chips, falafel |
| 🟡 Research file ready, awaiting migration | 11 | smash-burger, pasta-carbonara, weekday-bolognese, butter-chicken, thai-green-curry, pavlova, roast-chicken, barramundi-lemon-butter, lamb-shawarma, hummus, pad-thai |
| ⚪ No research yet — flagged for cook's Batch 2 | 27 | chicken-adobo, beef-stew, musakhan, kafta, fattoush, prawn-tacos-pineapple, sourdough-maintenance, sourdough-loaf, risotto, fish-tacos, french-onion-soup, braised-short-ribs, ramen, beef-wellington, dal, scrambled-eggs, aglio-e-olio, mujadara, sheet-pan-harissa-chicken, egg-fried-rice, nasi-lemak, beef-rendang, curry-laksa, char-kway-teow, saag-paneer, chicken-katsu, tom-yum, flour-tortillas |

**Migration status:** UI now correctly renders the 5 sections for all 6 Batch 1 recipes. The 11 yellow recipes have full source data in `docs/coo/culinary-research/*.md` — engineering migration into seed-recipes.ts is a tracked follow-up (next session). The 27 white recipes need the Cook to author research first; Cook handoff is in `docs/coo/handoffs.md`. UI gracefully renders nothing for absent fields — no broken state on recipes without populated data.

**REGN-007 root cause (diagnosed 7 May 2026):**
- Three symptoms reported by Patrick: (1) Undo on chip-add toast doesn't work, (2) Hitting X in Shop tab doesn't revert pantry chip, (3) Clicking already-added ✓ chip doesn't remove from shopping list.
- Single architectural root cause: the chip's `added` state was held in a local `Set<string>` inside `RecipeMatchCard`, NOT derived from shopping-list membership. Every state mutation was one-way (chip → shopping list). The chip had no way to learn that the shopping list had changed underneath it.
- Fix: chip visual state is now DERIVED from `shoppingItems.some(it => sameNorm(it.name, ing.name))`. Pantry tab loads shopping items on mount and on focus (useFocusEffect), so it reflects Shop-tab edits when the user comes back. All mutations route through pantry's `addToShoppingList` / `removeFromShoppingList` helpers, both of which update local state synchronously and persist to SQLite. Undo button calls `removeFromShoppingList(name)` — same pathway as the ✓-toggle. Toast holds the ingredient *name* (not the chip's local state), so undo survives chip re-renders.

**REGN-001 root cause (diagnosed 6 May 2026):**
- Previous fix addressed pantry carousel snap (REGN-001 original). The persistent card misalignment on the Kitchen screen is a separate but related issue.
- Root cause: FlatList windowing. RecipeCard heights vary (1–2 line title/tagline = ~315–358px). On Android, items outside the render window unmount; re-entry uses estimated positions → visible shift on scroll back.
- Fix: disabled windowing via `initialNumToRender={20}`, `maxToRenderPerBatch={20}`, `windowSize={99}`, `removeClippedSubviews={false}`. 17 active items (~340px each) = trivial memory cost.

## Session log — 6 May 2026 (Report 5)

### Build dispatched
| Build | Commit | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| #84 | `a8da5341` | ChipAdd redesign: Pressable+View split, rust outline→fill pill states, drop hint text |

### Changes this session
- **pantry.tsx** — ChipAdd fully redesigned: Pressable+View split fixes Android layout drop bug; 2px rust outline for "need" state; rust fill + white text for "added" state; removed "Tap to add to shopping list" hint text
- **RecipeMatchCard** — outer Pressable converted to static style + `android_ripple` (same Android layout bug fix)
- Root cause documented: Android silently drops layout/visual properties (borderRadius, backgroundColor, borderColor) from function-style Pressable `style` props

## Session log — 6 May 2026 (Report 4)

### Build dispatched
| Build | Commit | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| #83 | `078e616e` (SHA at time) | MiseItem Pressable+View split: borderWidth 1.5→2, fix layout stacking on Android |

### Changes this session
- **recipe/[id].tsx** — MiseItem component: Pressable bare touch target + inner View with all layout/visual styles static. Non-integer `borderWidth: 1.5` → `borderWidth: 2` (Android non-integer border rendering fix)
- **RecipeCard.tsx** — Difficulty pill text `color: tokens.ink` → `color: '#FFFFFF'` (dark text on dark scrim was unreadable)
- **seed-recipes.ts** — Added `whole_food_verified: true` to SMASH_BURGER (Zod refine was blocking `refreshSeedRecipeFields` silently)
- **types.ts** — Removed `whole_food_verified` `.refine()` enforcement per Patrick's explicit request; field data preserved, just not required
