A healthy starter that has been refrigerated looks flat, smells more sharply acidic, and may have a grey liquid on top (hooch — just stir it in or pour it off, it's harmless alcohol).", why_note: 'The bubbles are CO2 produced by wild yeast fermenting the flour. Peak activity (maximum bubble volume) is the window when your starter has the most leavening power — this is when to use it for baking. Hooch is ethanol produced when yeast runs out of food — it means the starter is hungry but not dead.' },

Stir vigorously — you want to incorporate air. Leave covered at room temperature. It will peak in 4–8 hours depending on temperature.', why_note: 'Discarding is not waste — it keeps the starter manageable in size and prevents acid build-up that would eventually suppress the yeast. The 1:1:1 ratio gives the culture enough food without overfeeding it, which dilutes the yeast population. Vigorous stirring oxygenates the culture, which yeast prefers in early fermentation.' },

To use from cold: take it out the night before, feed it, leave at room temperature overnight, use at peak the next morning.', why_note: 'Cold (4°C) dramatically slows fermentation — the culture stays dormant but alive. Weekly feeding is enough to keep the yeast population healthy. Taking it out 12 hours before baking gives it time to warm up and go through a full rise cycle so it has maximum strength when it goes into your dough.' },

Feed daily for 3–5 days at room temperature, discarding before each feed, until it doubles consistently within 6–8 hours.', why_note: 'Long neglect allows acetic acid bacteria to dominate over yeast (bacteria tolerate acidity better than yeast). Repeated feedings restore the balance by introducing fresh food and removing accumulated acid. Doubling consistently within 6–8 hours is the signal that the yeast population is strong enough for baking.' },

Black streaks or liquid are usually just over-fermentation. A consistently flat, non-rising starter after 5 days of daily feeding in a warm kitchen likely means the flour or water is inhibiting microbial activity — try bottled water and wholemeal flour.', why_note: 'Mould is a contaminant from the air and wins when acidity drops too low to protect the culture. Once mould is visible on the surface, it has almost certainly penetrated deeper — stirring it away does not fix it. Every other problem short of mould is recoverable with patience and consistent feeding.' },
