A healthy starter that has been refrigerated looks flat, smells more sharply acidic, and may have a grey liquid on top (hooch — just stir it in or pour it off, it's harmless alcohol).", why_note: 'The bubbles are CO2 produced by wild yeast fermenting the flour. Peak activity (maximum bubble volume) is the window when your starter has the most leavening power — this is when to use it for baking. Hooch is ethanol produced when yeast runs out of food — it means the starter is hungry but not dead.' },

Stir vigorously — you want to incorporate air. Leave covered at room temperature. It will peak in 4–8 hours depending on temperature.', why_note: 'Discarding is not waste — it keeps the starter manageable in size and prevents acid build-up that would eventually suppress the yeast. The 1:1:1 ratio gives the culture enough food without overfeeding it, which dilutes the yeast population. Vigorous stirring oxygenates the culture, which yeast prefers in early fermentation.' },

To use from cold: take it out the night before, feed it, leave at room temperature overnight, use at peak the next morning.', why_note: 'Cold (4°C) dramatically slows fermentation — the culture stays dormant but alive. Weekly feeding is enough to keep the yeast population healthy. Taking it out 12 hours before baking gives it time to warm up and go through a full rise cycle so it has maximum strength when it goes into your dough.' },
    { id: 's4', title: 'Reviving a neglected starter', content: 'If it has been in the fridge for months: pour off the hooch and any discoloured liquid. It may smell very sharp or like acetone. Feed daily for 3–5 days at room temperature, discarding before each feed, until it doubles consistently within 6–8 hours.', why_note: 'Long neglect allows acetic acid bacteria to dominate over yeast (bacteria tolerate acidity better than yeast). Repeated feedings restore the balance by introducing fresh food and removing accumulated acid. Doubling consistently within 6–8 hours is the signal that the yeast population is strong enough for baking.' },

  description: "Lasagne alla bolognese is from Emilia-Romagna, the rich-cooking region of northern Italy centred on Bologna. The defining element is the ragù — meat slowly braised in milk, wine, and tomato — codified in English-language kitchens by Marcella Hazan in the early 1990s. Italian migration to Australia after the Second World War brought the dish into Australian homes, where the Sunday lasagne tray became a cross-cultural household standard. This version stays close to Hazan's milk-first ragù; the assembly is the way most Australian families build it — most of the work is the wait, and the wait is what makes it taste like Bologna and not a tray of mince.",

  description: "Lamb roasted with rosemary and garlic comes from two heritages that both shaped Australian cooking: the Mediterranean (Italy, Greece, Spain — where lamb, herbs, and olive oil are everyday) and the British Sunday roast that arrived with colonisation. The slow-roast shoulder method — long, low, lid on for the first hour — is associated in Australia with Maggie Beer, whose Barossa kitchen made this style of cooking the modern Australian Sunday roast.

The chickpea version most Australians know is the Levantine adaptation, eaten daily across Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan, where it's street food, breakfast, and the heart of a thousand sandwich shops. This is that recipe: dried chickpeas (never tinned), soaked overnight, blitzed raw with herbs and spices, fried until the outside shatters and the inside is bright green and tender.
