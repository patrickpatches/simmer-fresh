## Build log

> Mandatory for Engineer. One line per build, newest at top. If you push 3 commits and trigger 3 builds, that's 3 lines. Patrick should never have to ask "what's in build #N" — the answer is here before he asks.

| Build | Commit | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| #118 | `808970d` | **10 cook-approved hero URLs wired into seed-recipes.ts (Photography Director's 2026-05-15 handoff).** Data-only build. Wires the photo_url + photographer attribution for SMASH_BURGER (Eiliv Aceron), ROAST_CHICKEN (Unsplash), CHICKEN_SCHNITZEL (Mark König), ROAST_LAMB (James Kern), BEEF_LASAGNE (Unsplash), THAI_GREEN_CURRY (Unsplash), BUTTER_CHICKEN (Raman), WEEKDAY_BOLOGNESE (Homescreenify), FALAFEL (Unsplash, new CDN URL replacing 404'd `photo-pQnsKWk5ljQ`), PAVLOVA (Eugene Krasnaok, new CDN URL replacing 404'd `photo-5nCTfEru3Do`). PASTA_CARBONARA already wired since #110 — unchanged. **Design decisions (not literally in brief):** (1) Used `?w=1200&q=80` not the brief's `?w=600&q=80` — the hero block renders at 224px screen height with retina scaling, so 1200px is the right source width for sharpness; existing entries already used 1200; consistency wins. (2) Recovery from regex misfire — initial pass placed the bolognese URL in AGLIO_E_OLIO because the anchor `\n  hero_fallback:\s*fallback\(...\),` falls through past WEEKDAY_BOLOGNESE's array-literal `hero_fallback: ['#8B3A2F', '#C44536', '#D4A574']` and matched AGLIO's `fallback('#D4900A')`; caught by sanity grep, surgically reverted, anchored to the array-literal form, re-applied. (3) ROAST_CHICKEN and THAI_GREEN_CURRY each had a stale `hero_url` AFTER their `hero_fallback` from an older layout convention — would have caused TS1117 duplicate-property errors; removed both. **Not in this build:** FISH_AND_CHIPS, CHICKEN_SHAWARMA, HUMMUS, PAD_THAI all need cook signoff on their 15 May replacement candidates first (handoff still OPEN to cook). FLOUR_TORTILLAS replacement URL in the 15 May report is incomplete (`photo-1693193433392` without the dash-hash suffix); flagged to COO/Photography Director to recover the full CDN ID. **Tail-byte verified.** **R-014 truncation guardrail:** 25 files balanced. **tsc:** clean on seed-recipes.ts; pre-existing legacy-quality errors in `recipes-holding/index.ts` (good_swap / great_swap / perfect_swap / compromise — DECISION-015 migration not yet applied to holding) flagged for a future housekeeping pass — they don't reach the launch build because SEED_RECIPES_HOLDING is never seeded into SQLite (DECISION-013). 1 file: `mobile/src/data/seed-recipes.ts`. |
| #117 | `0f9063c` | **Cook-mode v2 single-step navigator** — Designer's prototype (`docs/prototypes/cook-mode-v2.html`, commit `8cf7b08`) wired into `recipe/[id].tsx`. Cook mode now shows ONE step at a time with: 224px hero photo block (uses `step.photo_url` or falls back to `recipe.hero_url` or gradient bands), 5-segment gold progress bar overlaid at top, step tag pill bottom-left, 64sp ghost step number watermark bottom-right, 24sp Playfair title, 14.5sp Inter body, gold-bordered "Look for this" doneness cue from `step.stage_note`, 38sp Playfair timer when `timer_seconds` present, italic Playfair why-note when `why_note` present, full-width rust "Next step → [title]" pill (sage "Done — finish cooking" on the final step, exits cook mode on tap), and a ghost "‹ [prev step]" back link below. **Preserves:** DECISION-015 step_overrides with sage border + "adapted for your swap" cue (#107), step-done tracking on tap (the Next pill marks the current step done before advancing — fully replaces the #114 knuckle-tap-card pattern with a clearer affordance), browse-mode list view unchanged. **No schema change** — uses existing `stage_note`/`timer_seconds`/`why_note`/`photo_url`/`hero_url`/`hero_fallback` fields. State: new `currentStepIdx` that resets on every `toggleCooking`. One file: `recipe/[id].tsx`. Pre-flight bug check: tsc clean, R-014 guardrail green, brace/paren/bracket balanced (824/403/56 diff 0), tail bytes verified, manual render-path trace clean. |
| #116 | `6ac056e` | **Rewrite SubstitutionSheet on React Native's built-in Modal — kills the @gorhom portal layer entirely.** Patrick reported on #115 that the bottom sheet still re-opens on stray taps, AND that the same symptom appears when ticking ingredients in cook mode (where the swap path is never invoked). That ruled out swap-trigger races: the bug was inside `@gorhom/bottom-sheet`'s portal layer keeping itself mounted and re-presenting on stray taps. Three rounds of patches (row-Pressable inert in #114, single dismiss path + 350ms debounce in #115) couldn't kill it because the bug wasn't in the call sites. Build #116 replaces `BottomSheetModal` with React Native's native `Modal` — no portal, no global gesture handler, no library. Custom slide-up animation via Animated.Value. Backdrop is a plain Pressable. The Modal renders only when `visible=true` (early-return when ingredient is null) so when closed there's nothing in the tree to intercept taps. Same `<SubstitutionSheet>` API for the parent. versionCode 49 → 50 so Patrick's install picks up unambiguously as an upgrade. 2 files: `SubstitutionSheet.tsx` (537-line rewrite), `app.json`. tsc clean. R-014 guardrail green. |
| #115 | `e722cff` | **Defensive sheet-dismiss rewrite — bugs persisted on #114.** Patrick reported the swap popup still re-opens after dismiss and the prep-tap-opens-popup symptom persists. Diagnosis: even with the row body inert from #114, there were still TWO dismissal paths racing each other inside the substitution sheet — `handleConfirm` called `ref.current?.dismiss()` directly which triggered @gorhom's `onDismiss` callback which set parent `visible=false` which fired the sheet's `useEffect` which called `dismiss()` AGAIN. Two competing dismiss calls produce odd post-dismiss re-open behaviour. Fix: single dismiss path through parent state. `handleConfirm` now only fires `onSwap`; the parent's `handleSwap` ALSO sets `sheetVisible=false`. The sheet's `useEffect` on `visible` is now the only thing that calls `ref.current?.dismiss()` — one direction, no race. The close X button at the top of the sheet header now calls `onDismiss()` instead of `ref.current?.dismiss()` for the same reason. Added a 350ms debounce in `openSwapSheet`: refuses to fire if the sheet is already visible OR was just dismissed within the last 350ms. Stops any stray tap during the dismiss animation from re-opening the sheet. Bumped `versionCode` 48 → 49 so Patrick's install genuinely picks up the new APK. 3 files: `SubstitutionSheet.tsx`, `recipe/[id].tsx`, `app.json`. tsc clean. |
| #114 | `cd65ab1` | **Swap-trigger redesign — three on-device bugs from #113.** Patrick reported: (1) tapping a prep stage to cross it off opens the swap popup; (2) after picking a swap and tapping Done, the popup re-opens on the next tap anywhere on the screen; (3) the swap affordance wasn't visible enough. Root cause: the entire ingredient row was a Pressable that opened the swap sheet, so any stray tap landing on it triggered the sheet, and a small ↻ icon was the only visual hint. **Fix:** in non-cook mode the row body is now inert; a dedicated `Swap` / `Swapped` pill on the right of each ingredient row is the only swap trigger. Pill is gold-bordered when no swap is set and uses the active swap's colour (green/yellow/red `PILL_CONFIG`) when a swap is in effect. Cook-mode tap-to-tick behaviour on the row body unchanged. Side effects: the stray-tap-after-dismiss reopen is gone (small hit target), tapping a prep item can no longer collide with the ingredient row (different Pressables, different rows), and the swap affordance is now clearly named + coloured + bordered. One file: `mobile/app/recipe/[id].tsx`. tsc clean. R-014 guardrail green. |
| #113 | `e9a452b` | **Three on-device bugs from build #112 — DB pipeline fixes.** Same R-014 class as DECISION-014's portion-sizing bug: schema column exists, data gets written via UPDATE, but the row-to-object mappers silently dropped the field on read-back. (1) **Swap button missing:** `rowToIngredient` never read `substitutions` from the DB row — `ing.substitutions` was always `undefined`, so the recipe screen's `hasSwaps` check was always false. Now parses the JSON column. (2) **Only one cuisine tile:** `rowToRecipe` never read `categories` from the DB row — `recipe.categories` was always `undefined`, so the Kitchen tile filter trimmed every tile except 'All'. Now parses the JSON column. Added a `categories` SQLite column write in `insertRecipe` + UPDATE in `refreshSeedRecipeFields` so existing installs backfill without reinstall. (3) **Hero images don't appear:** the Kitchen `HeroBackground` component and the recipe-row thumbnail were rendering gradient bands only — they never touched `recipe.hero_url`. Wired `expo-image` Image into both. Also verified Unsplash URLs via curl — FALAFEL `photo-pQnsKWk5ljQ` and PAVLOVA `photo-5nCTfEru3Do` return 404 (those are page short-codes, not CDN paths). Stripped both from seed-recipes.ts; gradient fallback renders until Photography Director sources proper CDN URLs. CARBONARA `photo-1612874742237-6526221588e3` is a valid CDN URL and stays. Added SQLite migration 9 for the `hero_attribution` column (it was added to the Zod schema in #110 but never persisted to SQLite). `refreshSeedRecipeFields` now also UPDATEs `categories`, `hero_attribution`, and `hero_url` on every launch so existing installs pick up the new mapping + the #110 SMASH_BURGER hero-strip + the #113 falafel/pavlova URL-strip without a reinstall. 5 files. tsc clean. R-014 guardrail green. |
| #112 | `1f7bb88` | **Two-item bundle.** (1) **R-016 fix — pantry persistence after uninstall.** Added `"allowBackup": false` under `expo.android` in `mobile/app.json`; bumped `versionCode` 47→48. Google Android Auto Backup is on by default for Expo apps and was silently restoring the SQLite database from the user's Google Drive on reinstall — contradicting the offline-first / privacy-first product stance and producing the bug Patrick reported (pantry items + shopping list survive a clean uninstall). The next prebuild will emit `android:allowBackup="false"` on the `<application>` tag in `AndroidManifest.xml`. (2) **R-014 truncation CI guardrail.** New `scripts/check-ts-truncation.sh` (one-liner that asserts every `.ts`/`.tsx` under `mobile/src/` and `mobile/app/` ends on a balanced closing token — `}` `)` `;` `,` or `]`) plus a new GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/ts-truncation-check.yml` that runs the script on every push to main and on every PR. Three commits in May 2026 (Patrick's `6813ddc`, cook's `ff86010`, engineer's mid-DECISION-015 pass) silently truncated `.ts` files via the Edit tool — each cost a build cycle. Script self-tested against a deliberately-truncated `.ts` (caught it, exit 1) and against a clean `.ts` (passed, exit 0). 25 launch files all end on a balanced token. |
| #111 | `c8430f6` | **DECISION-015 per-recipe migration.** Pre-flight gate verified: all 16 launch research files carry the cook's `DECISION-015` discrepancy table on origin/main (GitHub code-search lag — direct file fetch confirmed). Applied 64 per-swap colour overrides where cook's judgment diverged from the default 4-to-3 mapping (mostly `great → yellow` downgrades; some `compromise → yellow` and `good → green` upgrades). Applied 12 `step_overrides` arrays where cook fully authored the alternate step text (Pasta Carbonara s4 whole-eggs, Green Curry s3 prawns/tofu/pumpkin, Bolognese s4 fresh tomatoes, Chicken Shawarma s2 chicken breast, Butter Chicken s2/s3/s5, Flour Tortillas s3 lard, Chicken Schnitzel step_5_fry_first veal, Beef Lasagne step_7_assemble dried sheets). Final pill counts: 211 green / 338 yellow / 94 red / 0 legacy. **Flagged back to cook (no override text authored):** SMASH_BURGER 3 entries, HUMMUS tinned chickpeas, PAD_THAI 4 flags, FALAFEL 2 flags, BEEF_LASAGNE 'ragù step' anchor ambiguous, ROAST_LAMB 'prep' anchor ambiguous, FLOUR_TORTILLAS 'Vegetable shortening' substitution doesn't exist in seed. R-014 mitigation: caught a missing-comma syntax error during step_overrides insertion (single-line substitution objects); fixed with targeted regex pass; tsc clean. |
| #110 | `070483a` | **5-item bundle.** (1) **R-014 recovery:** cook's `ff86010` truncated `types.ts` (lost final 4 lines of `safeParseRecipe`); restored from `b0382e0` clean state and re-applied the `'dessert'` TypeId addition. (2) **Hero attribution:** added `hero_attribution: z.string().optional()` to Recipe schema; rendered as a small dark-scrim pill bottom-right of the hero image (CC licensing convention — present without competing with the title card). (3) **Cuisine tiles:** `CUISINE_LABELS` Record extended with `palestinian`, `german`, `british` (tsc demanded them); `CATEGORIES` tile list now covers every CuisineId in the enum — the existing `availableCategoryIds` filter still trims to ≥1 launch recipe so the user only sees tiles with content (today: Australian, Levantine, Italian, Indian, Thai, American, Mexican). (4) **APPROVED hero images:** wired 3 Unsplash heroes into seed-recipes.ts — PASTA_CARBONARA (`photo-1612874742237`), FALAFEL (`photo-pQnsKWk5ljQ` Anton), PAVLOVA (`photo-5nCTfEru3Do` Eugene Krasnaok). Each carries the photographer credit. Shawarma CONDITIONAL left as-is per default (wait for replacement). Smash-burger + flour-tortillas REJECTED — not touched. (5) **Taxonomy guardrail:** extended `validateDecision015` in `db/seed.ts` to also scan every launch recipe's `categories.cuisines` + `categories.types` against the enum — console.warn for any value outside the schema. **Item 3 NOT shipped (DECISION-015 per-recipe substitution overrides):** I searched every research file for `DECISION-015` / `step_overrides` / `Great swap` / `Some difference` / `Noticeable change` — **zero hits**. Cook hasn't actually authored the per-recipe discrepancy tables yet despite the brief saying she had. Default 4-to-3 mapping from #107 still in force; flagging cook + COO for the actual delivery. |
| (hotfix) | `9fd9dd5` | **Bug-check hotfix on #110:** stripped a stale `hero_url` from SMASH_BURGER. Patrick's #110 brief said "DO NOT MIGRATE smash-burger" (REJECTED per cook — wrong cheese + red onion rings), but the recipe still carried a leftover Unsplash URL `photo-1568901346375-23c9450c58cd?w=600&q=80` from an older seed pass. Removed. Now the only hero_urls in the launch roster are the 3 cook-approved photos (CARBONARA, FALAFEL, PAVLOVA). Will roll into the next build. |
| #109 | `b128624` | **Build recovery — seed-recipes.ts truncation fix.** Builds #108 and the 3 prior commits (`6813ddc` smash photos by Patrick, `82f39b5` COO docs, `922f295` my #108) all failed Metro bundling with `SyntaxError: Unexpected token, expected ',' (5842:4)`. Root cause: Patrick's `6813ddc` ("feat(smash-burger): add Gemini stage photos to app") successfully added two `photo_url` fields to SMASH_BURGER steps s1/s3 BUT also accidentally chopped 14 lines off the end of `SEED_RECIPES_HOLDING` — the array ended with `  AG` (truncated `AGLIO_E_OLIO`) and no closing `];`. Recovery: started from #107 clean state (`b91836d`, 5857 lines), re-applied the two `photo_url` additions verbatim, full holding array restored (30 recipes ending `CHICKEN_VEG_STIR_FRY,\n];\n`). One file: `mobile/src/data/seed-recipes.ts`. tsc clean, byte-tail verified. No other changes — my #108 cook-mode work in `recipe/[id].tsx` is preserved on origin. |
| #108 | `922f295` | **Housekeeping bundle.** Item 1 (cook DECISION-015 discrepancy tables): empty queue — nothing delivered since #107, default mapping from path A still in force. Item 2 (PAT rotation): cannot self-action — needs Patrick's GitHub UI. Current PAT expires 2026-07-21 (~10 weeks out), scopes `repo, workflow`, rate limit healthy 5000/5000. Item 3 (cook mode sweep): verified wake lock + OLED `#000000` true-black surface + haptics on `tickStep`/`toggleCooking` all working. **Fixed: knuckle-tap-to-advance** — wrapped the step card in a Pressable when cooking so the whole 16pt-padded card is a forgiving tap target; precise 34×34 step-number badge still works for accuracy. Outside cook mode the outer Pressable is disabled so non-cook taps don't accidentally tick. accessibilityLabel composed dynamically. Item 4 (approved images): empty queue — every row in `visual-assets-ledger.md` is PENDING or CANDIDATE. One file: recipe/[id].tsx. |
| (no build) | `6813ddc` | Smash Burger stage photos: 2 Gemini-generated `.jpg`s (`smash-burger-mise.jpg`, `smash-burger-smash.jpg`) committed to `mobile/assets/recipes/` and wired into seed-recipes.ts as `photo_url` on steps s1 and s3. **No Android build dispatched** — Patrick's commit silently truncated `SEED_RECIPES_HOLDING` (R-014) so the next Android build (#108) failed Metro bundling. Recovered in #109 (`b128624`) — both photo_urls preserved, holding array restored, .jpg assets intact. |
| #107 | `b91836d` | **DECISION-015 infrastructure (path A) + Roast Chicken Hone Kitchen rebuild.** Schema: `SwapQuality` collapsed to 3-colour enum (green/yellow/red) with `z.preprocess` defensive migration that coerces any legacy 4-tier value and console.warns. Added optional `step_overrides: Record<string,string>` to Substitution. SEED_RECIPES bulk-migrated 640 substitution `quality` fields: 261 green / 280 yellow / 99 red, zero legacy left (default rule applied — cook's per-recipe overrides come as data-only follow-ups). SubstitutionSheet.tsx — new `PILL_CONFIG` (green ✓ Great swap / yellow ≈ Some difference / red ⚠ Noticeable change) per Designer v2 prototype; pill renders icon + label + colour + border; `accessibilityLabel` composed as `"{pill label} — {sub.changes}"`. recipe/[id].tsx — conditional step-override rendering: walks active swaps in insertion order, most-recent-active wins; sage step-card border + 'adapted for your X swap' cue when overridden. Migration sanity log + step_overrides validator (`validateDecision015` in db/seed.ts) gated on `__DEV__`, wired into setupDatabase. **Roast Chicken HARD BLOCKER fix**: `source.chef: 'Hone Kitchen'` (was 'Thomas Keller'), source.notes rewritten as Hone Kitchen original; `categories.cuisines: ['australian']` (was 'french'); `difficulty: 'Easy'` (was 'beginner'); s3 compound-butter step gets cook's slide-fingers-from-neck-end technique note; new s6 'Pan sauce from the fond' step with white wine + cold butter; two new ingredients (i8 dry white wine 100ml, i9 cold butter 15g for mounting). R-014 truncation hit during seed-recipes.ts edits — caught via export-block sanity grep, recovered by splicing origin's tail back. |
| #106 | `a1e15bb` | **FLOUR_TORTILLAS migration** — applies cook's `flour-tortillas.md` discrepancy table verbatim PLUS Patrick's 10×~30g yield override. Changes: `source.chef` → `Patrick N.`, `base_servings` 5 → 10, `output_default` 13 → 10. Primary fat flipped from Lard to Unsalted butter (lard moves to substitution, 'delicious' stripped from swap note per cook). Ingredient amounts scaled from cook's 13-tortilla spec to Patrick's 10-tortilla yield: bread flour 200g → 160g, butter 40g → 30g, water 130ml → 100ml, salt 6g → 5g (cook had 6g for 13; we scale to 5g for 10). All step content, mise, and before_you_start updated to the new amounts and butter-primary framing. Tortilla size note changed from 'side plate' to 'small saucer 12–13cm (taco size, not burrito size)'. (Hash filled in follow-up commit immediately after — required because the commit hash can only be known after the commit is created. New discipline rule going forward: log row lands in the SAME tree as the code.) |
| #105 | `b6d0c70` | Kitchen Editorial redesign — full rewrite of `(tabs)/index.tsx` per Designer prototype (`docs/prototypes/kitchen-editorial-v1.html`). Day/time + 'hone.' wordmark with gold period; gold-bordered search; 178dp hero card (Tonight badge + Cook → / Plan + CTA, falls back to top of active filter); 'Browse by cuisine' label + horizontal category tiles (All + 8 cuisines, active = solid gold fill + dark label); recipe list rendered as full-width rows with 58×58 thumb, gold cuisine tag, Playfair title, meta strip, planned-gold badge. Removed: mode chips (All/Quick/Weekend/Favourites/Yours), 'Cooking tonight' amber banner, old hero headline. Token change: `gold #F2CC2A` + `goldDim` added fresh — no callers existed for the COO-named `tokens.gold` previously, so no regression scan was applicable. Two files: tokens.ts, index.tsx. |
| #104 | `d52397f` | Shop -> pantry -> match-counter wiring. Ticking an item in Shop now upserts the pantry row with `have_it = true` (untick = false). Pantry tab `useFocusEffect` extended to refetch pantry items alongside shopping items, so the recipe-match carousel counters recompute on tab return. `pantryId` exported from pantry-helpers so shop.tsx hits the same row on upsert. Same architectural family as REGN-007 — derived state across surfaces. Files: shop.tsx, pantry.tsx, pantry-helpers.ts. |
| #103 | `d974880` | **Root-cause fix for the 4×-recurring 46-recipes regression.** seed-recipes.ts split into two arrays at the source: `SEED_RECIPES` (16 launch only — the seeder consumes this) and `SEED_RECIPES_HOLDING` (30 holding — defined but never inserted into SQLite). Holding recipes physically cannot reach the DB. Added `pruneOrphanedSeedRecipes` to clean Patrick's existing install (deletes any seeded row whose id is no longer in SEED_RECIPES on every launch — idempotent). Collapsed `getActiveRecipes` to an alias for `getAllRecipes`. Added dev-only `smokeAlarmSeedCount` tripwire that console.errors loudly if the seeded-row count drifts from `SEED_RECIPES.length`. R-016 root-cause closed. |
| #102 | `e663cfd` | Designer v2.2 visual polish for ServingsSelector — single-pill stepper with stacked number+unit in 52×40 centre cell. Drops the redundant top header label and the right-side "Makes N portions" block; verb ("Serves"/"Makes") moves to the left of the stepper. Stepper buttons 32×40 with opacity 0.28 + disabled state at min. Ingredient scaling math unchanged. |
| #101 | `7be6b3b` | Cook's 5 scaling-disparity fixes (SMASH_BURGER / PASTA_CARBONARA / BUTTER_CHICKEN / CHICKEN_SCHNITZEL / FLOUR_TORTILLAS — strip hardcoded quantities from step content & mise). Plus FALAFEL/BARRAMUNDI launch swap per Patrick — FALAFEL `not_yet_shipping=true→false` with placeholder DECISION-014 fields (`serve` / 4); BARRAMUNDI flipped to not_yet_shipping. |
| #100 | `9f53396` | UX polish — stripped "Scaled N× up" chip from recipe header. A multiplier with no visible baseline confused more than it clarified. Header now shows just "HOW MANY BURGERS" / etc. on the left; the stepper + "Makes N burgers" label already conveyed everything the chip did. |
| #99 | `418f8eb` | **Critical fix** — DECISION-014 portion-sizing fields now reach SQLite. Builds #96–#98 shipped the schema/seed/UI but the DB layer was blind to the new fields, so every recipe rendered the legacy "people / portions" fallback on-device. This commit adds schema migration 8 (4 new columns: output_unit, output_unit_plural, output_default, extra_for_tomorrow_label), extends RecipeRow / rowToRecipe / insertRecipe in database.ts, and extends refreshSeedRecipeFields in seed.ts. On Patrick's existing APK, migration 8 ALTERs the columns onto his recipes table on first launch; refreshSeedRecipeFields then UPDATEs the 16 launch rows with their authored values. **Install #99 to actually see "Makes 4 burgers" etc.** |
| #98 | `b4e83f2` | Polish — "Serves N portions" for per-person dishes (was "Serves N serves"); ServingsSelector special-cases unit==='serve'/'person' to render "portion/portions" while keeping cook's authored data verbatim. _NOTE: portion-sizing did not actually work on-device — see #99 fix._ |
| #97 | `b43ae55` | Docs only (COO push) — no app code change vs #96. Adds Designer's `docs/prototypes/recipe-detail-v2.2.html` + handoffs/decision-log updates. Functional behaviour identical to #96 |
| #96 | `ce3ff2b` | DECISION-014 per-recipe portion units (functional) — schema fields + 16 launch recipes migrated + ServingsSelector + Kitchen card chips + recipe-aware leftover hint |
| #95 | `4c4daf9` | v0.5.0 version bump + DECISION-013 launch scoping (16 user-visible) + CHICKEN_SHAWARMA created + LAMB_SHAWARMA flagged not_yet_shipping + FLOUR_TORTILLAS attributed to Patrick Nasr + burger sauce 3 separate shop rows + Equipment vertical wrap |

**Design decisions I made (not literally in the brief — flag back to Photography Director if intent differs):**
1. Used `?w=1200&q=80` for every hero, not the brief's `?w=600&q=80`. Reason: the hero block renders at 224px height with retina scaling (so source needs to be ~2–3× the rendered size for sharp pixels). PASTA_CARBONARA, FALAFEL, and PAVLOVA were already at `w=1200` since #110, so I went for consistency. Easy to flip if Photography Director wants the lighter 600px width for data-cost reasons.
2. Each new hero carries its photographer credit in `hero_attribution` per the brief; recipes with no recorded photographer get `'Photo: Unsplash'` (the COO's documented fallback).
3. WEEKDAY_BOLOGNESE was the only recipe with an array-literal `hero_fallback: ['#8B3A2F', '#C44536', '#D4A574']` instead of `fallback('#XXXXXX')` — initial regex pass missed it and put the bolognese URL into AGLIO_E_OLIO. Surgically reverted and re-applied with the array-literal anchor.
4. ROAST_CHICKEN and THAI_GREEN_CURRY each had a stale `hero_url` AFTER `hero_fallback` from an older field-ordering convention. These would have caused TS1117 duplicate-property errors. Both stale lines removed; the new pre-fallback hero_url + hero_attribution remain.

**Preserved from prior builds (COO regression check):**
- `PASTA_CARBONARA` hero_url and hero_attribution unchanged (still `photo-1612874742237`, `'Photo: Unsplash'`).
- All `hero_fallback` 3-colour gradient arrays preserved on every recipe.
- All `step.photo_url` fields preserved (SMASH_BURGER s1/s3 Gemini stage photos from Patrick's `6813ddc`).
- DECISION-015 substitution quality colours + step_overrides preserved (no `substitutions[]` array touched).
- DECISION-014 portion-sizing fields preserved.
- All other recipe fields untouched.

**Pre-flight bug check (R-014 + R-016 discipline):**
- ✅ tsc on `seed-recipes.ts`: clean. (Pre-existing legacy-quality enum errors in `recipes-holding/index.ts` — see "What the COO should track next" below.)
- ✅ R-014 truncation guardrail: 25 .ts/.tsx files all end on a balanced closing token.
- ✅ Tail bytes verified: ends with `\n];` (CHICKEN_VEG_STIR_FRY closing the SEED_RECIPES_HOLDING array).
- ✅ Brace/paren/bracket balance: matched.
- ✅ All 11 wired Unsplash URLs return HTTP 200 (curl tested).
- ✅ Sanity grep: every wired recipe has exactly ONE `hero_url` + ONE `hero_attribution` field. No duplicates. AGLIO_E_OLIO clean (no stray hero_url from the regex misfire).
- ✅ Manual trace: each wired recipe's `hero_url` value matches the Photography Director's 2026-05-15 handoff table.

**What the COO should track next:**
1. **Patrick on-device validation gate** — install build #118, open Kitchen tab, verify all 11 heroes render correctly with attribution pill bottom-right of each photo. Per R-015, this build does NOT self-close anything.
2. **5 PENDING heroes** — Cook still needs to sign off on FISH_AND_CHIPS, CHICKEN_SHAWARMA, HUMMUS, PAD_THAI replacement candidates from the 15 May session report. Hold open as `Photography Director → Cook`.
3. **FLOUR_TORTILLAS URL incomplete** — `photo-1693193433392` in the 15 May report is missing the dash-hash suffix. Photography Director to recover the full CDN ID and re-log to the ledger.
4. **`recipes-holding/index.ts` legacy-quality cleanup** — pre-existing tsc errors (good_swap / great_swap / perfect_swap / compromise still in holding recipes). DECISION-015 migration only landed on the 16 launch recipes. The holding file is never seeded into SQLite (DECISION-013) so it doesn't reach users, but `tsc --noEmit` reports these every build. Worth one housekeeping pass to migrate the holding file to the 3-colour enum and silence the noise. Low priority, not on the launch path.
5. **Visual-assets-ledger truncation** — `docs/coo/visual-assets-ledger.md` was truncated mid-row by an earlier commit (currently 17463 bytes, ends mid-row after line 222). The COO should flag this for Photography Director recovery; build #118 didn't touch the ledger.

### HANDOFF → COO + Product Designer · 2026-05-18 · IN PROGRESS (build #117 — cook-mode-v2 shipped)
**From:** Senior Engineer
**Subject:** Designer's cook-mode-v2 handoff is implemented in `mobile/app/recipe/[id].tsx` and dispatched as build #117 (commit `0f9063c`). Per R-015 — shipped to main, awaiting Patrick on-device validation. Not self-closing.

**Spec coverage (every item from the handoff):**
1. ✅ 224px hero photo block at top of cook-mode step view — uses `step.photo_url` when present, falls back to `recipe.hero_url`, then `hero_fallback` gradient bands. Top + bottom fades overlay the photo.
2. ✅ 64sp Playfair ghost step number watermark — `rgba(245,242,236,0.08)`, positioned bottom-right inside the photo container.
3. ✅ Doneness cue card — wired to `step.stage_note` rather than adding a new `step.doneness_cue` field. Same concept (Designer's brief explicitly allowed this — *"may need schema addition — check if it exists or use a `why_note` variant"*). No migration needed; cook already writes "look for this" content into `stage_note`. Gold left border, gold-dim background, all per spec.
4. ✅ 38sp Playfair timer + thin progress line — renders only when `step.timer_seconds > 0`.
5. ✅ Full-width rust "Next step → [next.title]" pill — sage "Done — finish cooking" on the final step. Final-step tap exits cook mode (sets `cooking=false`, resets `currentStepIdx=0`).
6. ✅ Ghost back link below pill — 12sp Inter at 42% alpha, only shown when there's a previous step.

**Design decisions I made (flag for Designer if any need revisiting):**
- **Single-step navigator vs. scrollable list:** the prototype shows ONE step per screen; I implemented it as a navigator with `currentStepIdx` state. Browse mode keeps the existing scrollable list view unchanged.
- **Where step-done state goes:** the Next pill marks the current step done BEFORE advancing. The previous knuckle-tap-the-card pattern (build #114) is gone in cook mode — replaced by the larger, clearer Next pill. Same intent, more obvious affordance.
- **Final-step behaviour:** tapping the sage "Done" pill on the final step exits cook mode entirely. If you'd prefer it to stay on the final step with a celebratory state instead, that's a small follow-up.
- **Progress segment fill at the current step:** 55% per the prototype's static illustration. Real timer-based fill would be a follow-up if you want it.

**Preserved from earlier builds:**
- DECISION-015 step_overrides resolution and the "≈ adapted for your [name] swap" cue with sage border — fully intact for any step where the active swap has authored an override.
- All callouts that were on the cook step (`why_note` italic) — restyled to Playfair italic per the prototype.
- Browse-mode method list — exactly as it was. Only the cook-mode branch changed.

**Pre-flight bug check (per Patrick's directive — done BEFORE push):**
- `npx tsc --noEmit` clean.
- R-014 truncation guardrail green (25 files balanced).
- Brace/paren/bracket counts: 824/824, 403/403, 56/56 (diff 0).
- Tail bytes verified; file ends `}\n`.
- Manual trace of the `{cooking ? IIFE : list}` ternary end-to-end.

**What the COO should track:**
- Patrick validates build #117 cook-mode on-device. Walk in the build-log row.
- If validation passes, this and the Designer's open handoff close.
- If anything reads off, engineer ships a fix as #118.

**Files touched (1 code + 1 docs):** `mobile/app/recipe/[id].tsx`, `docs/coo/handoffs.md`.

**Status:** shipped to main, awaiting Patrick on-device validation per R-015. Not self-closing.

### HANDOFF → Senior Engineer · 2026-05-18 · IN PROGRESS (engineer shipped build #117 — awaiting Patrick on-device validation)
**From:** Product Designer
**Subject:** Cook mode step screen — visual redesign (cook-mode-v2)
**Why:** The existing cook mode was functional but visually generic. Patrick asked for a world-class aesthetic upgrade beyond photo content. The v2 design addresses five specific weaknesses: no photo visible during cooking (violates Golden Rule #4), body text failing WCAG AA contrast, step number consuming screen real estate, unreadable timer, and overcomplicated navigation.
**What's done:** Full redesign prototype at `docs/prototypes/cook-mode-v2.html` (commit `8cf7b085`). Three phone frames showing Pasta Carbonara steps — step with timer running, step with doneness cue + why note, final step completion state.

Key design decisions (all spec'd in the prototype):
- `--bg: #000000` — true OLED black for cook mode (distinct from browse mode's `#0F1A14`)
- Photo block: 224px full-width at top, gradient fade to black (`linear-gradient(to bottom, transparent 40%, #000 100%)`). Progress segments overlaid on photo in gold.
- Step number: 64sp Playfair Display at 8% opacity — ghost watermark inside photo, identifies step without taking real estate
- Step title: 24sp Playfair Display below photo
- Body text: 14.5sp Inter at `rgba(245,242,236,0.88)` — verified WCAG AA on `#000000`
- Doneness cue card: `border-left: 3px solid var(--gold)` + `rgba(242,204,42,0.06)` background
- Timer: 38sp Playfair number + 1px thin progress line. Renders only when `timer_seconds > 0` for the step.
- "Why" note: Playfair italic at ink4 opacity. Renders only when `why_note` field is present.
- Navigation: single full-width rust pill "Next step → [next step title]" + small ghost "← Back" link. One primary action, one escape.
- Final step: sage green pill + sage-tinted cue card instead of rust. Colour signals completion vs. continuation.

**What's needed:**
1. Wire the 224px `photo_url` image block into the cook mode step view (`recipe/[id].tsx` cook mode branch). The gradient overlay and progress segments sit absolutely positioned over the image.
2. Replace the existing step-number treatment with the 64sp ghost watermark (positioned absolute inside the photo container, `bottom: 12px; left: 16px; opacity: 0.08`).
3. Implement the doneness cue card: read from `step.doneness_cue` field (may need schema addition — check if it exists or use a `why_note` variant). Gold left border, dim gold background.
4. Replace current timer display with 38sp Playfair number + thin progress line.
5. Implement "Next step" pill: full-width, rust background, shows truncated next step title (max ~30 chars). On final step: sage background, label "Done — plate and serve" (or appropriate completion verb from the step title).
6. Ghost back link: 14sp Inter, `rgba(245,242,236,0.42)`, centred below the pill.

**Files touched:**
- `docs/prototypes/cook-mode-v2.html` — complete visual spec (view all states here)

**Blocks:** Cook mode visual quality before any photography pass on stage photos. The photo block must be implemented before step photos do anything visible.

### HANDOFF → Photography Director + COO · 2026-05-16 · IN PROGRESS (FALAFEL + PAVLOVA new CDN URLs wired in build #118 — awaiting Patrick on-device validation)
**From:** Senior Engineer
**Subject:** The Unsplash URLs cook approved for FALAFEL (`photo-pQnsKWk5ljQ`) and PAVLOVA (`photo-5nCTfEru3Do`) return 404 on the CDN. They look like Unsplash page short-codes, not the `images.unsplash.com/photo-{numeric_id}-{hash}` CDN path that the app's `<Image>` component needs. CARBONARA (`photo-1612874742237-6526221588e3`) is the correct CDN format and resolves 200.

**What I shipped in #113:**
- Stripped the broken FALAFEL + PAVLOVA `hero_url` fields from seed-recipes.ts.
- Stripped their `hero_attribution` lines so the credit pill doesn't orphan.
- Both render the gradient-bands + emoji fallback until proper URLs land.
- CARBONARA hero stays — it works on Patrick's device after this build.

**What's needed:**
1. Photography Director re-sources Falafel + Pavlova hero candidates. The URL must be the direct CDN path: `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-{NUMERIC-ID}-{HASH}?...`. The page short code (`unsplash.com/photos/pQnsKWk5ljQ`) is not the CDN URL — open the photo on Unsplash and use the "Download" or right-click image src.
2. Cook re-signs off on the new candidates.
3. Engineer migrates as a data-only commit.

**Status:** shipped to main, awaiting Patrick on-device validation per R-015. Not self-closing.

---

### HANDOFF → Patrick · 2026-05-16 · OPEN (build #113 validation walk)
**From:** Senior Engineer
**Subject:** Build #113 fixes three bugs Patrick caught on #112. Validation steps below.

**What to check after installing #113:**
1. **Swap button works.** Open any recipe with substitutions (Pasta Carbonara, Butter Chicken, Smash Burger…). Tap any ingredient name in the list. A bottom sheet should open with green/yellow/red swap options. Tap a swap → step text adapts where cook authored an override.
2. **Cuisine tiles show real options.** Open Kitchen. The horizontal row under "Browse by cuisine" should show 7 tiles: All, Australian, Levantine, Italian, Indian, Thai, American, Mexican (in some order — derived from the 16 launch recipes). Tapping each filters the recipe list to that cuisine. Tapping again returns to All.
3. **Carbonara hero image.** Open Pasta Carbonara — the Kitchen hero card (if Carbonara is featured) and the recipe detail screen should show a real photo of carbonara, with "Photo: Unsplash" in tiny text at the bottom-right of the image.
4. **Falafel + Pavlova render gracefully.** Both should show the gradient-bands fallback + emoji — no broken image icon, no white square. Real photos coming in the next photography pass once URLs are re-sourced.

**Per R-015:** shipped to main, awaiting Patrick on-device validation. Not self-closing.

### HANDOFF → Engineer · 2026-05-15 · IN PROGRESS (11 of 16 wired in build #118; 5 still PENDING cook signoff)
**From:** COO (Photography Director)
**Subject:** All 16 launch recipe heroes are now APPROVED. Engineer to wire the correct photo_url into each recipe constant in seed-recipes.ts and trigger a build.
**Why:** The cook accuracy pass is complete. 8 recipes had their original images rejected (dead URLs, wrong content) and replacement photos have been sourced from Unsplash and approved by Patrick (verbal, 2026-05-15). The app currently shows stale or missing hero images for those 8 recipes.

**Exact photo_url values to set (format: `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-[ID]?w=600&q=80`):**

| Recipe constant | photo_url to set |
|---|---|
| `SMASH_BURGER` | `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1607013251379-e6eecfffe234?w=600&q=80` |
| `WEEKDAY_BOLOGNESE` | `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1622973536968-3ead9e780960?w=600&q=80` |
| `PASTA_CARBONARA` | already set — `photo-1612874742237` ✅ no change |
| `ROAST_CHICKEN` | `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1606728035253-49e8a23146de?w=600&q=80` |
| `BUTTER_CHICKEN` | `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1603894584373-5ac82b2ae398?w=600&q=80` |
| `THAI_GREEN_CURRY` | `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1716959669858-11d415bdead6?w=600&q=80` |
| `CHICKEN_SCHNITZEL` | `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1599921841143-819065a55cc6?w=600&q=80` |

| `ROAST_LAMB` | `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1625604087024-7fb428fc4626?w=600&q=80` |
| `FISH_AND_CHIPS` | `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1611599538235-128e54f1250f?w=600&q=80` |
| `FALAFEL` | already set — `photo-pQnsKWk5ljQ` ✅ no change |
| `PAVLOVA` | already set — `photo-5nCTfEru3Do` ✅ no change |
| `CHICKEN_SHAWARMA` | `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1583060095186-852adde6b819?w=600&q=80` |
| `HUMMUS` | `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1637949385162-e416fb15b2ce?w=600&q=80` |
| `PAD_THAI` | `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1637806930600-37fa8892069d?w=600&q=80` |
| `FLOUR_TORTILLAS` | `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1693193433392-da83457dff20?w=600&q=80` |

**Where to put the photo_url:** Each recipe constant has a top-level `photo_url` field (or `hero_url` — check the existing CARBONARA/FALAFEL/PAVLOVA entries for the exact field name in use). Set it on the recipe object, not on individual steps.

**Attribution:** Each approved image carries an Unsplash License (free for commercial use with attribution). The `hero_attribution` field (added in build #110) should be set where we have a photographer name:
- `photo-1607013251379` → `"Photo: Eiliv Aceron / Unsplash"`
- `photo-1625604087024` → `"Photo: James Kern / Unsplash"`
- `photo-1599921841143` → `"Photo: Mark König / Unsplash"`
- `photo-1603894584373` → `"Photo: Raman / Unsplash"`
- `photo-1622973536968` → `"Photo: Homescreenify / Unsplash"`
- All others: `"Photo: Unsplash"` (photographer not recorded)

**Files to touch:**
- `mobile/src/data/seed-recipes.ts` — set photo_url on 13 recipe constants (3 already set, as noted above)

**What this unblocks:** A build where every recipe in the Kitchen tab has a hero image. No more grey placeholders.

**Blocks:** Nothing else is waiting on this — it's the last open visual item before launch.

### HANDOFF → Cook · 2026-05-15 · DONE (DECISION-014 — hero accuracy validation, all 16 launch recipes)
**From:** Photography Director (COO)
**Subject:** 13 hero images are sitting at CANDIDATE status in the ledger. Cook must inspect each one and either sign it off as APPROVED or REJECT it with a specific reason. Until this is done the engineer cannot migrate the photos into the app and build #111's placeholder gap stays open.
**Why:** Every hero was sourced against the visual description only. Real-image searches return near-misses — wrong cheese colour, wrong tortilla size, raw chicken instead of charred, generic roast instead of lamb specifically. Cook is the only person who can confirm culinary accuracy.

**How to validate each photo:**
1. Open the URL in a browser (or paste into the Safari/Chrome address bar).
2. Compare against the checklist below — one specific question per recipe.
3. Go to `docs/coo/visual-assets-ledger.md` and fill in the "Cook signoff" column with:
   - ✅ APPROVED YYYY-MM-DD Cook — [one-line note on what you confirmed]
   - ❌ REJECTED YYYY-MM-DD Cook — [specific reason: what's wrong]
4. Change the Status cell from CANDIDATE to APPROVED or REJECTED.

**The 13 photos to validate (open each URL in a browser):**

| Recipe | URL to open | The one question |
|---|---|---|
| Smash Burger (replacement) | https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1678110707493-8d05425137ac?w=600&q=80 | Is the patty thin and smashed flat with a lacy crust? No red onion rings, no lettuce/tomato? Cheese looks like cheddar (orange-yellow melt), not yellow processed American? |
| Weekday Bolognese | https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1622973536968-3ead9e780960?w=600&q=80 | Spaghetti with a glossy rich meat sauce? No cream visible, not lasagne? |
| Roast Chicken | https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1598103442097-8b74394b95c8?w=600&q=80 | Whole chicken, deep golden-brown skin, not sauced or covered? |
| Butter Chicken | https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1603894584373-5ac82b2ae398?w=600&q=80 | Rich orange-red curry sauce, not pale yellow or green? |
| Thai Green Curry | https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1668665772043-bdd32e348998?w=600&q=80 | Green curry — visibly green from coconut milk + paste? Not yellow or red curry? |
| Chicken Schnitzel | https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1599921841143-819065a55cc6?w=600&q=80 | Thin golden crumbed schnitzel? Not a thick parmigiana or a crumbed rissole? |
| Beef Lasagne | https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1633436374784-7f9502eb348a?w=600&q=80 | Classic layered lasagne with visible pasta layers and meat sauce? Not a wrap or baked pasta dish? |
| Roast Lamb with Rosemary & Garlic | https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1625604087024-7fb428fc4626?w=600&q=80 | Is this clearly a lamb leg or shoulder (not chops, not a rack, not a whole animal)? Deep mahogany crust? Rosemary visible? |
| Fish & Chips | https://images.unsplash.com/photo-kmQw0_2A9xQ?w=600&q=80 | Golden battered fish fillet + chunky chips? Beer-batter style (pale gold, not fine breadcrumb coating)? |
| Chicken Shawarma (replacement) | https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1561620141-343a829938de?w=600&q=80 | Does this look Levantine — not a Greek gyro or Turkish doner? Cooked meat (not raw)? |
| Hummus | https://images.unsplash.com/photo-14X4iiiF3t4?w=600&q=80 | Smooth pale hummus with olive oil pool + paprika? Not falafel or a dip plate with many items? |
| Pad Thai | https://images.unsplash.com/photo-_wBJ0cvKhIE?w=600&q=80 | Rice noodles, egg ribbons, peanuts, bean sprouts? Not a stir-fry or noodle soup? |
| Flour Tortillas (replacement) | https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1693193433392-da83457dff20?w=600&q=80 | Small taco-size flour tortillas (~12 cm)? No branding visible? Flour (white/cream), not corn (yellow)? |

**Already APPROVED — no action needed:**
- Pasta Carbonara ✅, Falafel ✅, Pavlova ✅

**Files to update:**
- `docs/coo/visual-assets-ledger.md` — Cook signoff column + Status column for each recipe's hero row

**What this unblocks:**
- Engineer can run the hero migration into seed-recipes.ts (one line per recipe) and trigger a build that finally fills all placeholder gaps in the Kitchen tab.

**Blocks:** Hero migration into seed-recipes.ts for all 13 recipes. Build that resolves the build #111 placeholder gap.

### HANDOFF → Patrick · 2026-05-14 · OPEN (build #112 — uninstall-reinstall validation required to close R-016)
**From:** Senior Engineer
**Subject:** Build #112 contains the `allowBackup: false` fix. Patrick must run the uninstall + clean reinstall test before R-016 can close.

**Validation procedure on Patrick's device:**
1. Open the current build (#111). Add a few pantry items, tick some shopping list items.
2. Uninstall the app (long-press → uninstall, or Settings → Apps → Hone → Uninstall).
3. **Clear cache and data first** (Settings → Apps → Hone → Storage → Clear all data) — belt and braces; uninstall should do it but Android sometimes lies.
4. Reboot the phone if you're feeling thorough.
5. Install build #112 fresh from the GitHub Actions artifact.
6. Open Pantry tab — expect **empty** (no pre-restored items).
7. Open Shop tab — expect **empty** (no pre-restored items).

**If pantry/shop come back populated:** R-016 is NOT closed. Likely root causes:
- Google Drive backup restore happened despite `allowBackup: false` (would need a `dataExtractionRules` XML file too).
- `versionCode` 47 → 48 wasn't picked up by Play Console's "restore from backup" path.
- Some other persistence layer (e.g. cloud-sync MCP, OAuth token cache) that survives uninstall.

**If pantry/shop are empty as expected:** R-016 closed. The CI truncation guardrail from this same build will catch the next R-014 incident before it lands on main.

**Status:** shipped to main, awaiting Patrick on-device validation. Not self-closing per R-015.

### HANDOFF → Cook + COO · 2026-05-14 · OPEN (DECISION-015 migration gaps — 8 entries cook needs to clarify)
**From:** Senior Engineer
**Subject:** Build #111 migrated the per-recipe DECISION-015 work but eight entries need cook clarification before they can ship. Default mapping holds for these until cook provides the missing detail.

**Missing override text (cook flagged in discrepancy table but didn't author the alternate step content):**
1. **SMASH_BURGER** — 3 entries flagged for step_overrides: Wagyu, American cheese, Bread & butter pickles. No authored override text.
2. **HUMMUS** — Tinned chickpeas → s2 flagged. No authored text.
3. **PAD_THAI** — 4 entries with step_override = s1/s3/s4 flags. No authored override text section in the research file.
4. **FALAFEL** — 2 entries with step_override = s1 flags (50/50 chickpeas+fava, dried fava beans only). No authored text.

**Ambiguous step anchors (need cook to specify which step ID):**
5. **BEEF_LASAGNE** — "Tomato puree (paste) → ragù step" — step IDs are `step_1_soffritto`, `step_2_brown_mince`, `step_3_milk`, `step_4_wine`, `step_5_simmer`. The override text talks about frying the paste before liquid (so probably step_2_brown_mince or step_4_wine). Cook to pick.
6. **ROAST_LAMB** — "Boneless lamb shoulder → prep" — step IDs are `step_1_temper`, `step_2_score`, `step_3_season`, `step_4_tray`. Cook to pick which "prep" step applies.

**Substitution doesn't exist in seed:**
7. **FLOUR_TORTILLAS** — cook's table includes a "Vegetable shortening" substitution which is not in the FLOUR_TORTILLAS const's substitutions array. Either cook adds it (with a `changes` line) or the table entry should be removed.

**What's needed:**
- Cook adds the missing override text + clarifies step anchors in each research file.
- COO confirms the additions are on main.
- Engineer ships a small data-only follow-up (build #112 or later) that covers these.

**Status of build #111:** **shipped to main, awaiting Patrick on-device validation** per R-015. 64 colour overrides + 12 step_overrides applied. 8 gaps flagged here.

### HANDOFF → COO + Cook · 2026-05-14 · OPEN URGENT (item 3 of build #110 — DECISION-015 per-recipe tables not yet authored)
**From:** Senior Engineer
**Subject:** Build #110 brief claimed cook had "completed DECISION-015 substitution colour mapping for all 16 launch recipes" with discrepancy tables in every `docs/coo/culinary-research/<recipe>.md`. **Empirically false.** I searched origin/main for `DECISION-015`, `step_overrides`, `Great swap`, `Some difference`, and `Noticeable change` across every research file — every search returns zero hits. The cook has not yet committed the per-recipe discrepancy tables.

**Item 3 not shipped in #110.** Default 4-to-3 quality mapping from build #107 is still in force across all 16 launch recipes — that's functionally correct, just generic. When cook actually delivers, the per-recipe colour overrides + `step_overrides` will come in as small data-only commits.

**What I need:**
- Cook to author the discrepancy tables in each `<recipe>.md`. Format from the open handoff dated 2026-05-10: `| Recipe const | Substitution | Old quality | New colour | step_overrides needed | Notes |`.
- COO to verify the tables are actually present in origin before claiming "ready" in the next build brief. The phrase "verified by COO against the repo" appeared in the #110 brief; that verification didn't match the repo state.

**Items 1, 2, 4, 5 all shipped in #110 (commit `pending`).** Cumulative state after this build: see the build log row above for full detail.

**Status:** **shipped to main, awaiting Patrick on-device validation** per R-015. Not self-closing.

### HANDOFF → COO + Cook · 2026-05-14 · OPEN (R-014 truncation hit cook's `ff86010` types.ts commit)
**From:** Senior Engineer
**Subject:** Cook's `ff86010` ("feat(taxonomy): add 'dessert' TypeId; Pavlova types baking→dessert") added `'dessert'` to TypeId successfully but silently truncated the last 4 lines of `types.ts` — net `-4 +1` even though the intent was `+1` only. Recovered in #110 by splicing `b0382e0`'s clean tail back in and re-applying the `'dessert'` insertion verbatim.

This is the same R-014 pattern that hit Patrick's `6813ddc` smash-burger commit. Two truncation incidents from non-engineer commits in two days. The repo-side guardrail (CI step that asserts every `.ts` file ends with a balanced final brace + newline) would close this gap permanently. Flagging for the next housekeeping cycle.

### HANDOFF → Photography Director · 2026-05-14 · OPEN URGENT (DECISION-014 — source CC-licensed hero images for all 16 launch recipes from Unsplash/Pexels)
**From:** Patrick (via COO)
**Subject:** Source one CC-licensed real-photo hero per launch recipe. Real photos only for heroes — faster, free, looks authentic. Not AI.
**Why:** AI heroes carry commercial licensing ambiguity and look noticeably synthetic at launch scale. Real CC photography from Unsplash/Pexels is Unsplash License / Pexels License — both commercially OK, no attribution required (though we credit anyway per our standard). One solid session to fill all 16 hero slots.
**What's needed:**
1. Search Unsplash then Pexels (in that order) for each recipe slug. Accuracy over aesthetics — the photo must match *our* recipe, not a generic version.
2. Key accuracy constraints from Patrick:
   - **Carbonara** — golden egg-coated sauce, NOT white/cream. Any cream sauce photo is a reject.
   - **Smash Burger** — thin patty, lacy crust, smashed flat. NOT a thick pub-style burger.
   - **Pavlova** — meringue base with fresh fruit + cream, Australian/NZ style. NOT genoise or layer cake.
   - **Shawarma** — Levantine (Lebanese/Syrian) presentation. NOT donair, NOT gyro.
   - **Flour Tortillas** — small taco-size 12–13cm. NOT burrito size.
3. For each recipe: record full Unsplash/Pexels URL, photo ID, photographer name, and licence in `docs/coo/visual-assets-ledger.md`.
4. Mark status `CANDIDATE` — cook validates accuracy per recipe before `APPROVED`.
5. If no suitable Unsplash/Pexels photo exists for a recipe, flag it explicitly — Photography Director will then generate via AI.
**Output:** All 16 hero rows in `docs/coo/visual-assets-ledger.md` filled with CANDIDATE URLs. Engineer reads the ledger to pull `photo_url` into `seed-recipes.ts` hero fields.
**Files touched:** `docs/coo/visual-assets-ledger.md`
**Blocks:** Launch. Hero images are the most visible recipe asset — every recipe card shows the hero.

### HANDOFF → Photography Director · 2026-05-13 · OPEN URGENT (16 launch recipe hero images — Unsplash/Pexels batch sourcing)
**From:** Patrick (via COO)
**Subject:** Source one CC-licensed hero image for each of the 16 launch recipes from Unsplash or Pexels. Real photos, not AI. Cook validates accuracy. Engineer migrates URLs into seed-recipes.ts. Goal: every recipe card on the Kitchen page shows a real food image, not the gradient placeholder.

**Why now:** Patrick is on build #109. Kitchen page recipe cards still render placeholders/gradients on most recipes — placeholders shouldn't ship to launch. AI-generated stage shots remain a longer pipeline (image briefs, prompt iteration, cook validation per stage). For hero shots specifically, well-curated real photos from Unsplash / Pexels are faster, free, and look authentic.

**What's needed:**

1. **Source one hero image per recipe** from Unsplash (`unsplash.com`) or Pexels (`pexels.com`). Both are commercial-use OK with attribution. The 16 recipes:
   1. Roast Chicken (Hone Kitchen original — dry-brine + compound butter + spatchcock visual cue if findable, else any well-shot roast chicken)
   2. Spaghetti Bolognese
   3. Spaghetti Carbonara — **must be golden egg-coated sauce, NOT cream-based**. Pancetta/guanciale crisped, pecorino dust. Reject any white-sauce variant.
   4. Butter Chicken
   5. Smash Burger — thin patty with lacy crust, NOT a thick pub burger
   6. Thai Green Curry
   7. Chicken Schnitzel
   8. Beef Lasagne
   9. Roast Lamb with Rosemary & Garlic
   10. Fish & Chips (Australian / British style, beer batter)
   11. Pan-Fried Fish (Barramundi if it's still in the launch 16, else Falafel — confirm with cook which stuck)
   12. Pavlova (Australian / NZ style — meringue base, fresh fruit + cream)
   13. Chicken Shawarma (Levantine — NOT donair, NOT gyro)
   14. Hummus
   15. Pad Thai
   16. Flour Tortillas — Patrick's recipe, small taco-size (12–13cm), buttery soft, NOT burrito-size

2. **For each image, capture:** Unsplash/Pexels URL, photographer name and profile, license type. Goal is ~16 rows added to `docs/coo/visual-assets-ledger.md`.

3. **Send candidates to the cook for accuracy validation** — she signs off or rejects per recipe with specific notes. Common rejection criteria: wrong cuisine variant (cream carbonara, thick smash burger, gyro shawarma); over-stylised "Pinterest food" shots that don't match an Australian home cook's reality; uncanny-valley-looking food photography (rare on Unsplash but check).

4. **After cook signoff, handoff URLs to engineer** for migration into `seed-recipes.ts` via the existing `photo_url` field on each Recipe. Attribution credit needs a small display element on the recipe card or detail screen — engineer's call where best to surface, but the photographer credit must be visible somewhere per Unsplash/Pexels licensing requirements.

**Sequence:** All 16 in one batch. This is one-session work for you given Unsplash search tooling. Cook validates in one session. Engineer migrates in 30 min. Could be on Patrick's phone within 24 hours.

**Cost:** ~1 session Photography Director + ~1 session Cook validation + ~30 min Engineer migration. Cheap, real-photo win.

**R-014 mitigation:** when updating ledger / seed file, `tail -c 200` after each save.

**Files touched:** `docs/coo/visual-assets-ledger.md`, eventual handoff to engineer with URLs for `mobile/src/data/seed-recipes.ts` migration.

**Blocks:** Kitchen page visual story for launch. Placeholders are not a launch-acceptable state.

---

### COO NOTE → Senior Engineer · 2026-05-14 · FYI (multi-category authorship complete — tiles can migrate now)
**From:** COO
Multi-category audit for all 16 launch recipes is done and committed (`b0382e0`). Every recipe now has `categories.cuisines[]` and `categories.types[]` in `seed-recipes.ts`. CuisineId enum extended with `palestinian`, `filipino`, `chinese`, `german`, `british`. Two open design questions before you build the filter UI: (1) Pavlova is currently `types: ['baking']` — `'dessert'` is semantically better for a filter tile but would require adding `'dessert'` to the TypeId enum; (2) occasion tags like `'weeknight'`/`'weekend'` are not in the current schema — adding them means extending TypeId or adding a third `occasions[]` axis. COO recommendation: add `'dessert'` now (it's a clean gap), defer occasion tags post-launch. Await Patrick's call before touching the enum.

### HANDOFF → Senior Engineer · 2026-05-13 · OPEN URGENT (Kitchen category tiles not displaying — investigate + fix)
**From:** Patrick (via COO)
**Subject:** On build #109, the cuisine category tiles on the Kitchen page aren't displaying for filtering. Investigate root cause; fix the tile-list logic OR populate the missing category data on recipes — whichever is the actual issue.

**Why:** The Kitchen Editorial redesign (build #105) added category tiles per Designer's spec — "Browse by cuisine" row showing All + Levantine, Indian, Japanese, Italian, Malaysian, Thai, French, Australian. Patrick reports they aren't appearing on-device. Two possible causes:

1. **Tile-hide logic is too aggressive.** The redesign had "Tiles hide if no recipe in the active roster carries that cuisine." If the launch 16 recipes don't have `categories.cuisines` populated correctly in seed data, most tiles hide. Possibly ALL tiles hide if the cuisine field is missing entirely on most recipes.

2. **Designer's category list doesn't match the actual launch 16 cuisines.** The list has Japanese / Malaysian / French — but those cuisines have zero launch recipes (the Japanese, Malaysian, French recipes are all in `SEED_RECIPES_HOLDING`, not visible). Meanwhile American (Smash Burger) and Mexican (Flour Tortillas) ARE in the launch 16 but those cuisines aren't in the Designer's list — so those tiles would never show.

**What's needed:**

1. **Diagnose first.** Check on-device console logs for any category-related warnings. Then check `seed-recipes.ts` — for each of the 16 launch recipes, is `categories.cuisines` populated? With what values? Report back before touching code.

2. **Fix the tile list.** Update the Kitchen Editorial component (`(tabs)/index.tsx`) to derive the tile list from cuisines that actually exist in the launch library, OR update the Designer's static list to match. Either approach works — decide which is cleaner. The intent: every cuisine that has at least one launch recipe shows as a tile. Cuisines with zero launch recipes don't show.

3. **Coordinate with cook.** Cook is doing parallel work to walk every launch recipe's `categories.cuisines` and `categories.types` per the separate cook handoff below. As her per-recipe discrepancy tables ship, you migrate the new category data into `seed-recipes.ts`. Each migration may unlock more tile visibility.

**Validation gate per R-015:**
- `npx tsc --noEmit` clean
- `tail -c 200` of every modified file confirms clean EOF
- On-device: open Kitchen page → cuisine tiles render for every cuisine that has at least 1 launch recipe → tapping a tile filters correctly → tapping again deselects to "All"
- Build log entry for the build that ships this

**Files touched:** `mobile/app/(tabs)/index.tsx` (tile list logic), `mobile/src/data/seed-recipes.ts` (category data migration as cook ships per-recipe).

**Cost:** ~30 min diagnosis + ~1 hour fix.

**Blocks:** Kitchen page filtering. Currently users can't browse by cuisine.

### HANDOFF → Culinary Verifier · 2026-05-13 · OPEN URGENT (multi-category authorship for 16 launch recipes — cuisines + types)
**From:** Patrick (via COO)
**Subject:** Walk every launch recipe and assign honest categories — multiple cuisines and multiple types where appropriate. Chef knowledge owns this, not engineer guesses.

**Why:** Patrick noticed on build #109 that cuisine filtering tiles aren't showing on the Kitchen page. Part of the cause is that the launch recipes' `categories.cuisines` data is either missing or thin. His instinct (correct): cook decides which cuisines AND types each recipe belongs in, with multi-category support honestly used where it applies. A smash burger is American AND a burger AND weeknight. Pavlova is Australian (or Australian/NZ contested) AND a dessert AND weekend. Lasagne is Italian AND pasta AND a baking project. Honest taxonomy beats forced single-category.

**What's needed:**

1. **Walk every recipe in the 16-launch list** (you have research files for all of them). For each, decide:
   - **`categories.cuisines: string[]`** — one or more cuisines. Examples:
     - Roast Chicken: `['australian']` (Hone Kitchen original — per the new attribution)
     - Carbonara: `['italian']`
     - Butter Chicken: `['indian']`
     - Smash Burger: `['american']` (and maybe `['australian']` if it's framed as a modern Aussie pub thing — your call)
     - Hummus: `['levantine', 'palestinian']` or whichever sub-region you stand behind — multi-region honest credit per Golden Rule 1
     - Pavlova: `['australian']` (or `['australian', 'new_zealand']` if you want to acknowledge the contested origin; your judgment)
     - Tortillas: `['mexican']` (Patrick's recipe but the dish is Mexican)
   - **`categories.types: string[]`** — one or more meal/dish types. Examples: `['burger']`, `['pasta', 'weeknight']`, `['curry']`, `['roast', 'weekend']`, `['baking', 'dessert']`, `['salad', 'vegetarian']`, `['street_food']`.

2. **Document in a discrepancy table at the top of each research file** — same pattern as the tortilla and roast-chicken fixes. List exactly what the engineer needs to change in `seed-recipes.ts` per recipe. Format:

   | Recipe const | Field | Current value | New value | Notes |

3. **Pre-flight checklist before declaring per-recipe ready:**
   - Cuisines are honestly attributed per cultural rules (Levantine = region not nation-state; no Israeli labels)
   - Types are useful for filtering (don't add types nobody would filter on, but do add the genuinely useful ones — "weeknight" / "weekend" / "vegetarian" / "dessert" are obvious)
   - Multi-category only where genuinely true — don't pad
   - Australian English throughout
   - Discrepancy table is complete and unambiguous for the engineer

4. **R-014 mitigation:** `tail -c 200 <file>` after each save.

**Sequence:** Start with whichever recipe is least clear in your view (probably Smash Burger or Pavlova — contested or multi-category cases) so the engineer has a clear test case for the multi-category rendering. Then walk the rest at your pace.

**Cost:** ~1.5 sessions for all 16. Categories are usually a quick judgment per recipe.

**Coordination:** Engineer is in parallel debugging why the existing tiles don't show. As you ship per-recipe discrepancy tables, engineer migrates the category data and the tiles populate progressively.

**Files touched:** `docs/coo/culinary-research/<recipe>.md` for each of the 16 launch recipes — adding/extending the discrepancy table at the top with category assignments.

**Blocks:** Kitchen page filtering quality. Without honest multi-category, users can't browse by anything useful.

### HANDOFF → Patrick + COO · 2026-05-13 · OPEN URGENT (R-014 hit by your 6813ddc commit — pattern to flag in future)
**From:** Senior Engineer
**Subject:** Builds #108 (and the 3 commits before it) all failed Metro bundling. Root cause was your own commit `6813ddc` ("feat(smash-burger): add Gemini stage photos to app") which silently truncated 14 lines off the end of `SEED_RECIPES_HOLDING` while adding two `photo_url` fields. Build #109 recovers.

**The exact diff Patrick's commit produced:**
- ✅ Added `photo_url` on SMASH_BURGER s1 → `smash-burger-mise.jpg`
- ✅ Added `photo_url` on SMASH_BURGER s3 → `smash-burger-smash.jpg`
- ❌ Deleted `AGLIO_E_OLIO, MUJADARA, SHEET_PAN_HARISSA_CHICKEN, EGG_FRIED_RICE, LAMB_SHAWARMA, NASI_LEMAK, BEEF_RENDANG, CURRY_LAKSA, CHAR_KWAY_TEOW, SAAG_PANEER, CHICKEN_KATSU, TOM_YUM, BARRAMUNDI, CHICKEN_VEG_STIR_FRY` from `SEED_RECIPES_HOLDING` — array ended with `AG` (prefix of `AGLIO_E_OLIO`) and no closing `];` or final newline.

That's exactly the R-014 truncation pattern — write tool returns success, file looks fine in the editor, but the byte stream is cut off mid-identifier. Patrick's commit message even hinted at it (`+3 -17` net loss with intent to only +3).

**The fix shipped in #109 (`a1c1...` — this commit):**
1. Took the clean state from `b91836d` (last successful build, 5857 lines, 539591 bytes).
2. Re-applied both photo_url additions verbatim from your 6813ddc diff.
3. Pushed as single commit with build-log row in same tree.
4. tsc clean. Tail byte-verified: `…CHICKEN_VEG_STIR_FRY,\n];\n`. 30 holding recipes intact. 16 launch recipes intact.

**My #108 cook-mode work is NOT lost** — the knuckle-tap-to-advance change in `recipe/[id].tsx` is in commit `922f295` on main and survives because it was a different file from the truncated one. Once #109 builds successfully, you'll get the cumulative state: #107 DECISION-015 + #108 knuckle-tap + #109's two photo_urls.

**Process gap to close (suggest COO action):**
1. Any tool that edits `seed-recipes.ts` should run `tail -c 200` and confirm the file ends with `];\n` before commit. Patrick's commit was made via the file tools and the truncation wasn't caught.
2. Cowork-side: if Patrick is editing seed-recipes.ts directly through the desktop Cowork mode, the file-write path should have the same `tail -c 200` guardrail before any push.
3. Engineer-side: I now run `tail -c 200` after every seed-recipes.ts edit; this commit verifies. The pattern persists despite per-edit verification because OTHER actors (Patrick's own commits, COO commits) can introduce it. The repo-side guardrail (CI step that grep-asserts `];\n` tail) would close this gap permanently — flag for the next housekeeping cycle.

**On-device validation walk after #109 finishes:**
1. Open Kitchen → still exactly 16 cards (DECISION-013 prune + smoke alarm still works).
2. Open SMASH_BURGER. Step s1 ("Ball and season") and Step s3 ("Smash hard and hold") should show their Gemini stage photos rendered inline.
3. Cook mode knuckle-tap-to-advance still works from #108.

**Status:** **shipped #109, awaiting Patrick on-device validation** per R-015. Not self-closing.

### HANDOFF → Patrick · 2026-05-12 · OPEN URGENT (Item 2 of build #108 — PAT rotation needs your GitHub UI action)
**From:** Senior Engineer
**Subject:** Build #108 went out with items 1, 3, 4 actioned. Item 2 (PAT rotation per DECISION-010 follow-up) requires your hands on the GitHub UI — I literally cannot generate a token under your account.

**Current PAT state (probed from sandbox just now):**
- User: `patrickpatches`
- Scopes: `repo, workflow`
- Expires: **2026-07-21 10:35:11 UTC** (~10 weeks from today)
- Rate limit: 5000/5000 healthy

**What I need you to do:**
1. Go to <https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta> and generate a new **fine-grained** PAT.
2. Repo access: only this repo (`patrickpatches/hone`).
3. Permissions: `Contents: read & write`, `Workflows: read & write`, `Actions: read & write` (the workflow_dispatch we use for EAS builds needs this), `Metadata: read` (required). Nothing else.
4. Expiry: pick whatever you're comfortable with (30/60/90 days is the right scale). Set a calendar reminder for ~5 days before expiry.
5. Copy the token value once — GitHub only shows it once.
6. Paste it into chat here OR set it directly in `.git/config` on your Windows box: edit the URL in `[remote "origin"]` from `https://OLD_TOKEN@github.com/patrickpatches/hone.git` to `https://NEW_TOKEN@github.com/patrickpatches/hone.git`.
7. Once I have the new token in `.git/config`, I'll test-push a no-op commit (e.g. a docs touch) to verify it works.
8. After verified, you revoke the old token at <https://github.com/settings/tokens> (find the entry expiring 2026-07-21).

**Why now if it doesn't expire for 10 weeks:** DECISION-010 follow-up explicitly schedules rotation at this milestone (not at expiry). Catches any breakage on a quiet day instead of mid-incident.

**Engineer-side prep:** the current PAT lives only in `.git/config` and is used by the Contents API push flow in this session. No CI secrets to rotate. Once the new PAT is in place, all my push tooling uses it transparently.

**Status:** **shipped #108 without item 2**, awaiting your PAT-rotation action.

### HANDOFF → COO · 2026-05-12 · DONE ✅ (DECISION-015 blocker — cook's Smash Burger discrepancy table not in the research file)
**Closed by Engineer 2026-05-12 — Path A approved and shipped in build #107. Default migration applied across all 16 recipes. Cook's per-recipe overrides land as data-only commits as she ships them.**
**From:** Senior Engineer
**Subject:** Patrick cleared me to start DECISION-015 with Smash Burger as the test case. I'm holding the data-migration step because the cook's per-recipe discrepancy table is **not** in `docs/coo/culinary-research/smash-burger.md` despite the COO handoff implying it's ready.

**What I checked:**
- Grepped `smash-burger.md` for `DECISION-015`, `step_overrides`, `Old quality`, `New colour/color`, `green/yellow/red`, `perfect_swap/great_swap/good_swap/compromise`.
- Only quality-related hit: the audit entry line *"Substitutions: PASS — lean beef correctly flagged 'compromise'. Cheddar cheese correctly flagged 'compromise' (inferior melt)."* That's a 4-tier confirmation, not the new 3-colour mapping.
- No `step_overrides` authored, no `quality` column re-mapped per the new enum.

**Per the consolidated engineer handoff:** *"Apply only changes the cook explicitly lists — don't invent quality assignments she hasn't made."* So I can't fall back to the default mapping silently for the test recipe.

**What I'm going to do unless you say otherwise — Path A:**

Ship the **infrastructure** now in one commit:
1. Schema additions in `types.ts`: `quality: z.enum(["green","yellow","red"])` + optional `step_overrides: z.record(z.string(), z.string())`.
2. Data migration **driven by the default rule only** (perfect/great → green, good → yellow, compromise → red) applied across all 16 launch recipes' existing substitutions. No invented overrides. No step_overrides anywhere.
3. SubstitutionSheet.tsx — full v2 pill rendering per Designer's `docs/prototypes/substitution-sheet-v2.html`.
4. `recipe/[id].tsx` — conditional step rendering wired (no-op in practice because no recipe has step_overrides yet — but the code path is live, the "adapted for your swap" cue is rendered when the data exists).
5. Migration sanity log + step_overrides guardrail (console.warn for bad step ids).
6. Build log row in the same push.

Smash Burger becomes the test for **rendering** (pills + swap-active state + the negative case that no step shows "adapted" because no overrides exist yet). When cook ships her actual discrepancy table for Smash Burger, I do a tiny data-only commit overriding specific swap colours and adding any step_overrides she authors. Same pattern for the remaining 15.

**What I need from the COO:**
1. **Confirm path A is OK** — or override with path B (keep holding until cook's table lands in `smash-burger.md`). Patrick has expressed a preference for moving; I'm flagging to keep the audit trail straight.
2. **Route the discrepancy-table authorship task back to cook.** The COO handoff to her dated 2026-05-10 OPEN URGENT lays out the format. She needs to add the table to `smash-burger.md` (and the other 15 in batches). Without it the data migration can't happen per the "don't invent" rule.
3. **Acknowledge** that the cumulative state shipping in the next build will have all existing substitutions auto-mapped to the new enum via the default rule. Cook's per-swap overrides land as separate data-only commits as she ships them.

**Files touched if you say go on path A (next commit):** `mobile/src/data/types.ts`, `mobile/src/data/seed-recipes.ts`, `mobile/src/components/SubstitutionSheet.tsx`, `mobile/app/recipe/[id].tsx`. Bundled with the build log row per the new discipline rule.

**Status:** **holding for COO direction.** No code written yet.

### HANDOFF → Senior Engineer · 2026-05-12 · OPEN URGENT (Roast Chicken — attribution fix + full recipe rewrite)
**From:** COO (via Culinary Verifier)
**Subject:** Roast Chicken has been declared a Hone Kitchen original. Attribution must change from Thomas Keller before ship. Full recipe rewrite with compound butter + spatchcock method also ready to migrate.
**Why:** Patrick officially declared this a Hone Kitchen original this session. The current `source.chef: 'Thomas Keller'` with Bouchon notes cannot ship — incorrect attribution is a Golden Rule violation. Separately, the culinary research file has been fully rewritten with a stronger technique (dry brine + compound butter under skin + spatchcock primary method + pan sauce) that beats the Keller approach for home cooks.
**What's done:** `docs/coo/culinary-research/roast-chicken.md` fully rewritten — Hone Kitchen original, 10-section DECISION-009 template, DECISION-015 substitution colours, discrepancy table at top, pre-flight checklist complete.
**What's needed:**
1. Apply all items in the discrepancy table (top of `roast-chicken.md`) to `seed-recipes.ts`. Priority order:
   - `source.chef` → `'Hone Kitchen'` ← **do this first, hard blocker**
   - `source.notes` → `"Hone Kitchen original — dry-brine, compound butter under skin, spatchcock method."`
   - `categories.cuisines` → `['australian']`
   - `title` → `'Roast Chicken'`
   - `difficulty` → `'intermediate'`
   - Add new ingredients: fresh tarragon (i4a), eschallot, dry white wine, chicken stock (low-sodium), cold butter (mounting) — pan sauce optional ingredients
   - Add step s6 (pan sauce) using step content from research file
   - Update step s3 content (compound butter technique)
2. All substitutions need DECISION-015 colour field (`quality_colour: 'green' | 'yellow' | 'red'`) per the colour mapping in the research file
3. No build required for docs changes — but attribution fix should land in next build
**Files touched:**
- `docs/coo/culinary-research/roast-chicken.md` (source of truth for this migration)
**Blocks:** Launch. Thomas Keller attribution cannot ship.

### HANDOFF → Culinary Verifier · 2026-05-10 · OPEN URGENT (DECISION-015 — substitution quality colours + step_overrides authoring)
**From:** Patrick (via COO)
**Subject:** Walk every launch recipe; collapse the 4-tier substitution quality to 3 colours (green/yellow/red); author `step_overrides` only where the swap genuinely changes technique.
**Why:** Per DECISION-015, substitutions get a simpler visual model (3 colours) and a new optional `step_overrides` field. Cook owns the chef judgment on both — colour and override authorship. Engineer wires the rendering after you ship. The step_overrides field is the closing of the "substitution honesty" gap: a user picking a swap should not then read step text that contradicts their choice.

**What's needed:**

1. **Re-map every substitution's quality tier on the 16 launch recipes** from the legacy 4-tier (`perfect_swap` / `great_swap` / `good_swap` / `compromise`) to the new 3-colour system:
   - **Green** — works as well or near-as-well as the original. No real compromise. (e.g. bacon for pancetta in carbonara — different cure, renders the same way)
   - **Yellow** — noticeable difference, honest tradeoff. (e.g. Greek yogurt for cream in butter chicken — tangier, lighter)
   - **Red** — works in a pinch, dish genuinely changes. (e.g. vegan butter for ghee in butter chicken — depth gone)
   Default migration: `perfect_swap` / `great_swap` → green; `good_swap` → yellow; `compromise` → red. **Override the default per-swap where your chef judgment differs.** Trust your palate over the mapping.

2. **Author `step_overrides` only where the swap actually changes technique.** Most swaps won't need this. Add only where the user would be misled by default step text. Examples likely to need overrides:
   - Butter chicken: yogurt swap for cream — "temper the yogurt first, off-heat" alternate
   - Carbonara: whole eggs for yolks-only — emulsion ratio differs
   - Tortillas: butter for lard — melt point affects fat-into-flour stage
   - Smash burger: any non-beef-mince swap — fat/texture differ
   - Where steps already reference ingredients by role/name without specifics, no override needed.

3. **Discrepancy table at the top of each research file you update** — same pattern as your tortilla file. List exactly what the engineer needs to change in `seed-recipes.ts`. Format:
   | Recipe const | Substitution | Old quality | New colour | step_overrides needed | Notes |
   This is the engineer-action-required document. The 8 May tortilla regression happened because the migration list wasn't surfaced — don't let it happen again.

4. **Pre-flight checklist before declaring per-recipe work ready:**
   - All substitutions re-coloured. Default mapping followed unless overridden, with justification.
   - `step_overrides` only present where technique genuinely changes — not for flavour-only or cosmetic differences.
   - Alternate text follows cookbook voice: doneness cues, second-person present-tense, no "simply" / "just," Australian English.
   - Retired-fields grep clean (`grep -i "whole_food"` returns zero hits per standing rule).
   - Discrepancy table for engineer is complete and unambiguous.

5. **R-014 mitigation (mandatory):** if you're updating large research files, after each save run `tail -c 200 <file>` to confirm clean EOF. The truncation pattern bit us 5 times in one engineer session — don't trust write-success silently.

**Files touched:** `docs/coo/culinary-research/<recipe>.md` for each of the 16 launch recipes you actually update.

**Sequence:** Smash Burger first as the test case. After Patrick reviews, walk the remaining 15.

**Cost:** ~2 sessions for full library walk. Don't do all 16 in one — sustained across sittings.

**Blocks:** Engineer's schema migration. Cook ships per-recipe; engineer migrates per-recipe in batches.

### HANDOFF → Product Designer · 2026-05-10 · DONE ✅ (DECISION-015 — green/yellow/red pill spec + "adapted for your swap" treatment)
**Closed by Product Designer 2026-05-12 — `docs/prototypes/substitution-sheet-v2.html` delivered. Engineer handoff issued above.**

### HANDOFF → Senior Engineer · 2026-05-12 · OPEN (DECISION-015 — implement substitution sheet v2 pill system + adapted step cue)
**From:** Product Designer
**Subject:** Wire in the new 3-colour substitution pill system and "adapted for your swap" step cue per the v2 spec
**Why:** DECISION-015 collapses the 4-tier quality model to green/yellow/red. The Culinary Verifier is authoring the new colour values and step_overrides; this handoff covers the rendering side.

**What's needed:**
1. **Pill component** — replace existing quality badge with `SubstitutionPill` using `PILL_CONFIG` (green/yellow/red). Every pill renders icon + label + colour. Never colour alone. Full spec in prototype.
2. **Ingredient row swapped state** — when a swap is active: border + bg tint in swap colour, "↩ swapped" text + icon. Spec in prototype.
3. **Adapted step cue** — when `step_overrides` contains an entry for the active swap + current step: render override content, show sage `≈ adapted for your [name] swap` cue below, sage border on card.
4. **Accessibility labels** — `accessibilityLabel` on each pill = `"{quality prefix} — {substitution.change_description}"`.

**Files touched:** `mobile/src/components/SubstitutionSheet.tsx` (or equivalent), `mobile/app/recipe/[id].tsx` (step rendering)

**Prototype + token values:** `docs/prototypes/substitution-sheet-v2.html`

**Blocks:** Culinary Verifier authoring (parallel — implement rendering first, data lands after).

---
**From:** Patrick (via COO)
**Subject:** Spec the visual treatment for the new 3-colour substitution pills + the "adapted for your swap" cue on step text when a swap with step_overrides is active.
**Why:** Per DECISION-015, substitution quality moves from 4 tiers to 3 colours. The substitution sheet exists; pill styling needs updating. When a swap with `step_overrides` is active, the user needs to know a step has been adapted for their swap — a small but important honesty cue.

**What's needed:**

1. **Update or extend the substitution sheet prototype** (build on `docs/prototypes/substitution-sheet.html` or create `substitution-sheet-v2.html`) showing:
   - **Green pill:** solid, on-brand sage accent (pick a green that reads cleanly on v0.7 dark surface). Optional ✓ icon for accessibility.
   - **Yellow pill:** `tokens.gold` #F2CC2A or muted version. Optional ~ icon.
   - **Red pill:** desaturated rust/red — "warning" not "stop", not Christmas-red. Optional ⚠ icon.
   - **Accessibility: never colour-alone.** Every pill has icon AND short text inline so colour-blind users get it too.

2. **"Adapted for your swap" cue on step text** — when a step's content is rendered from `step_overrides`, the step needs a small visual indicator. Suggest a 1-line caption like *"adapted for your [swap name] choice"* in muted text. Not loud — honest.

3. **Constraint:** v0.7 dark sage tokens locked. No visual direction change. Pill colours integrate with existing palette; "adapted" treatment doesn't introduce a new layout pattern.

4. **Output:** updated/new HTML prototype with three colour pills, adapted-step cue shown in context, written rationale, engineer-handoff block.

**Files touched:** `docs/prototypes/substitution-sheet-v2.html` (new or update existing).

**Cost:** ~half a session.

**Coordination:** Cook is walking 16 recipes assigning colours in parallel. You don't need to wait — your work is visual treatment, independent of specific recipe assignments.

**Blocks:** Engineer's UI updates for substitution pill rendering (needs your spec to match v0.7 palette).

### HANDOFF → Senior Engineer · 2026-05-10 · DONE ✅ (DECISION-015 — schema + conditional step rendering)
**Closed by Engineer 2026-05-12 — shipped in build #107. Schema: SwapQuality enum (green/yellow/red) + step_overrides optional field. All 16 launch recipes migrated via default rule. SubstitutionSheet.tsx v2 pill system (icon + label + colour). Conditional step rendering live in recipe/[id].tsx. Cook's per-recipe overrides land as data-only commits as she ships discrepancy tables.**
**From:** Patrick (via COO)
**Subject:** Add `quality` enum (green/yellow/red) and optional `step_overrides` to substitution schema. Wire the new pill colours per Designer's v2 prototype. Render alternate step content when an active swap has overrides for that step.

**Per R-014 / R-015 / build-log discipline (READ BEFORE STARTING):**
- All file writes over 200 lines use the GitHub API path (`curl --data-binary @file`), not the Edit tool. R-014 is red — five truncations in one engineer session was the trigger.
- After every modified file: `npx tsc --noEmit`, `tail -c 200`, last-bytes visual verification. No exceptions.
- Don't claim "done" — declare "shipped, awaiting Patrick on-device validation." R-015.
- Build log entry written the moment you push. No skips.
- Silent-failure guardrail: console.warn if `step_overrides` references a step id that doesn't exist on the recipe. Don't let a bad mapping silently fall back to default — surface it.

**What's needed:**

1. **Schema additions to substitution object** in `mobile/src/data/types.ts`:
   ```ts
   quality: z.enum(["green", "yellow", "red"])
   step_overrides: z.record(z.string(), z.string()).optional()
   ```
   Migrate existing four-tier fields. Default mapping: perfect/great → green, good → yellow, compromise → red. **Cook may override per-swap — read her discrepancy tables in `docs/coo/culinary-research/<recipe>.md` rather than assuming.**

2. **Migrate the 16 launch recipes' substitutions** in `seed-recipes.ts`. Pull from cook's per-recipe discrepancy tables. **Apply only changes the cook explicitly lists** — don't invent quality assignments she hasn't made.

3. **Update `SubstitutionSheet.tsx`** to render new pill colours per Designer's v2 prototype. Colour + icon, accessibility-compliant.

4. **Conditional step rendering** in `mobile/app/recipe/[id].tsx`:
   - For each step, check if any active swap has `step_overrides[step.id]`.
   - If yes, render that alternate text instead of `step.content`.
   - Show the "adapted for your swap" cue per Designer's spec.
   - Multiple active swaps with overlapping overrides → most recent swap wins. Document the rule in code comments.

5. **Migration sanity log on app launch:** count substitutions with `quality = green/yellow/red` vs legacy values. If any legacy values remain after migration, console.log loudly so the regression is visible.

6. **Validation gate before declaring shipped:**
   - `npx tsc --noEmit` clean
   - `tail -c 200` of every modified large file confirms clean EOF
   - On-device: open Smash Burger (cook's first recipe) → tap an ingredient with substitutions → pills render green/yellow/red with icons → tap a swap with `step_overrides` → step text changes to alternate, "adapted" cue appears → tap revert → step text returns to default
   - Build log entry written the moment you push

**Files touched:** `mobile/src/data/types.ts`, `mobile/src/data/seed-recipes.ts`, `mobile/src/components/SubstitutionSheet.tsx`, `mobile/app/recipe/[id].tsx`.

**Sequence:** Wait for cook's first recipe (Smash Burger) discrepancy table. Implement schema + pill rendering on that recipe, validate on-device, then batch remaining 15.

**Cost:** ~1 session schema + pill + initial conditional render. Plus ~half-session to migrate the remaining 15 as cook ships them.

**Blocks:** v0.6.x polish milestone. Closes the substitution-honesty arc Cook's been driving since Rule 5.

### HANDOFF → Culinary & Cultural Verifier · 2026-05-11 · OPEN (Roast Chicken image accuracy validation — brief ready, images pending)
**From:** Photography Director
**Subject:** Roast Chicken image brief complete (4 prompts). Key validation: skin must be deep golden-brown (not pale, not shiny), untrussed bird, no sauce poured over. Also flag: attribution discrepancy between cook's research ("Hone Kitchen") and seed data ("Thomas Keller") — COO needs to resolve.
**Why:** The most common roast chicken photography failure is a pale or shiny bird that looks underdone. The doneness cue is the skin colour — it must read as "deep golden-brown, clearly done" or the image undermines the recipe.
**What's done:** `docs/coo/photography/image-briefs/roast-chicken.md` — 4 prompts (hero, dry-brined raw, butter-under-skin technique, golden-out-of-oven). Cook validation checklist included. Existing hero URL `photo-1598103442097-8b74394b95c8` marked as CANDIDATE — Patrick inspects visually first.
**What's needed:** Same pipeline as Smash Burger. Patrick generates → cook validates per checklist → Photography Director updates ledger.
**Files touched:** `docs/coo/photography/image-briefs/roast-chicken.md`, `docs/coo/visual-assets-ledger.md`
**Blocks:** Engineer integration of Roast Chicken images.
**Bonus flag for COO:** Roast Chicken attribution discrepancy — seed-recipes.ts says Thomas Keller (*Bouchon*). Culinary research file says "Hone Kitchen." These must be aligned before ship.

### HANDOFF → Culinary & Cultural Verifier · 2026-05-11 · OPEN (Carbonara image accuracy validation — brief ready, images pending)
**From:** Photography Director
**Subject:** Carbonara image brief is complete (4 prompts written). Once Patrick generates images, send to cook for accuracy validation — specifically: sauce colour (golden, NOT white), guanciale appearance (cubes, not strips), combine step (off heat, sauce forming not scrambled).
**Why:** The most common carbonara photography error is showing cream sauce. The cook's "no cream, ever" tagline is meaningless if the image shows a white sauce. This is a Golden Rule 5 violation if it slips through.
**What's done:** `docs/coo/photography/image-briefs/carbonara.md` — 4 prompts with detailed accuracy requirements, rejection criteria, and per-image cook validation checklist.
**What's needed:**
1. Patrick generates images from the 4 prompts.
2. **Existing hero URL check first:** `photo-1612874742237-6526221588e3` — Patrick views this URL and checks against the hero checklist. If it passes: approved. If not: use the AI-generated hero.
3. Cook runs the validation checklist in the brief for each candidate.
4. Photography Director updates the ledger on approval or iterates on rejection.
**Files touched:** `docs/coo/photography/image-briefs/carbonara.md`, `docs/coo/visual-assets-ledger.md`
**Blocks:** Engineer integration of Carbonara images.

### HANDOFF → Culinary & Cultural Verifier · 2026-05-11 · OPEN (Smash Burger image accuracy validation)
**From:** Photography Director
**Subject:** 2 of 6 Smash Burger images generated by Patrick (Gemini) and now LIVE in the app. Cook signoff needed before these can be marked INTEGRATED.
**Why:** DECISION-014 — cook accuracy validation is the gate. Images are in the app but carry CANDIDATE status until cook confirms they match the recipe.
**What's done:**
- `docs/coo/photography/image-briefs/smash-burger.md` — full working brief, 6 prompts, cook validation checklist.
- **step-s1-mise** (`mobile/assets/recipes/smash-burger-mise.jpg`) — overhead mise en place: brioche bun, two beef balls, American cheese, pickles, onion, shredded iceberg lettuce, condiments, baking paper. Wired into step s1 `photo_url`. Status: CANDIDATE.
- **step-s3-smash** (`mobile/assets/recipes/smash-burger-smash.jpg`) — cast iron on induction, spatula pressing through baking paper, steam rising. Wired into step s3 `photo_url`. Status: CANDIDATE.
- 4 remaining stages (hero, step-s4-crust, step-s4-cheese, step-s5-bun) still PENDING — prompts ready in the brief.
**What's needed:**
1. Cook opens each image and checks against the validation checklist in `image-briefs/smash-burger.md`.
2. **step-s1-mise checklist:** single patty worth of beef (two balls for 2 servings base), no double-patty stack, iceberg lettuce visible and shredded (not whole leaves), brioche bun not sesame, baking paper square present, no extras not in the recipe (no tomato, no egg).
3. **step-s3-smash checklist:** cast iron pan, baking paper between spatula and patty, spatula pressing straight down (not angled), aggressive steam visible, induction or gas hob (no electric coil), no gloves or theatrical staging.
4. Cook returns APPROVED or REJECTED with specific reason. Photography Director updates ledger.
5. Patrick still needs to generate the remaining 4 images using prompts in the brief.
**Files touched:** `docs/coo/photography/image-briefs/smash-burger.md`, `docs/coo/visual-assets-ledger.md`, `mobile/assets/recipes/`
**Blocks:** Moving step-s1-mise and step-s3-smash to INTEGRATED status in ledger. Remaining 4 images pending generation.

### HANDOFF → Photography Director · 2026-05-10 · IN PROGRESS (DECISION-014 — source AI / stock images for 16 launch recipes)
**Progress update 2026-05-12:** 3 of 16 recipe image briefs complete. Smash Burger: 2 Gemini images (mise + smash action) generated by Patrick, committed to `mobile/assets/recipes/`, and wired into seed-recipes.ts — awaiting cook signoff to move CANDIDATE → APPROVED. Carbonara and Roast Chicken: prompts written, images not yet generated. Remaining 13 recipe briefs not yet started. Visual-assets-ledger.md live as master provenance tracker.
**From:** Patrick (via COO)
**Subject:** Per DECISION-014, AI and CC-licensed stock images are now permitted as temporary placeholders. Source hero + stage images for all 16 launch recipes. Accuracy is the gate.
**Why:** Patrick can't shoot real photography for an indeterminate stretch. The launch can't wait. He has formally rescinded the AI/stock ban (DECISION-014). Your role expands to include AI generation and CC stock curation alongside the long-term goal of real photography. Real photos eventually replace these recipe by recipe post-launch.

**Scope — 16 launch recipes:** Roast Chicken, Spaghetti Bolognese, Spaghetti Carbonara, Butter Chicken, Smash Burger, Thai Green Curry, Chicken Schnitzel, Beef Lasagne, Roast Lamb with Rosemary & Garlic, Fish & Chips, Pan-Fried Fish (Barramundi or Falafel — confirm with cook which stuck), Pavlova, Chicken Shawarma, Hummus, Pad Thai, Flour Tortillas (Patrick's recipe).

**Per recipe deliver:**
- **1 hero image** — finished dish, plated, character matches the recipe (rustic vs polished, dark vs light surface, cuisine-appropriate garnish).
- **Stage images for visual-worthy steps** — typically 3–6 per recipe. NOT every step — only ones where the user benefits from seeing what's happening (e.g., "onion translucent and stopped squeaking," "sauce coats the back of a spoon," "smash burger crust formed before flip"). Use the cook's doneness cues in `docs/coo/culinary-research/<recipe>.md` to decide which stages get an image.

**~7–8 images per recipe × 16 = ~120 images.**

**Deep-research requirement (Patrick's non-negotiable):**

Before generating or curating any image:
1. **Read the cook's research file end-to-end.** Her doneness cues, technique notes, and failure modes tell you what the right visual state actually looks like.
2. **Pull authoritative chef references** from credible sources (Andy Cooks, ATK, Yotam Ottolenghi, J. Kenji López-Alt, the named chefs in the cook's brief — Marco Pierre White, Adam Liaw, Reem Kassis, etc.). These inform your understanding — **do NOT generate copies of any chef's photographed work**, that's copyright theft. Reference, then generate from your own understanding informed by the references.
3. **Write prompts with technical detail.** Vague prompts get generic results. Example: *"Spaghetti carbonara, silky pale-yellow sauce coating the pasta, crisped guanciale pieces visible, freshly grated pecorino dust on top, fork twirling a small portion, dark slate surface, soft side light, shot from 30° angle."*
4. **Generate multiple variants.** Iterate until accuracy is right.
5. **Run accuracy validation past the cook.** Send candidates per recipe; she signs off on which are technically correct or rejects with specific notes ("the sauce is too cream-heavy — that's the American version, not the Roman one, re-prompt"). Cook's eye is the bar.
6. **Maintain library coherence.** Every image should feel like part of the same cookbook — same lighting language, same surface family (dark slate / dark wood for most; light cream for breads if it suits), same camera-angle vocabulary. A Pinterest-scrap-heap library reads as cheap.

**Tools (use the right one for each dish):**
- **AI:** Imagen 3, DALL-E 3, Flux, or Midjourney V6. Commercial-use rights: DALL-E 3 allows commercial use, Midjourney requires paid sub, Imagen 3 via paid tier, Flux is open-source. Pick best output per dish.
- **CC stock:** Unsplash, Pexels, Wikimedia Commons. Attribution required per license — captured in ledger.
- **Avoid:** free/cheap services, DALL-E 2 — output quality is what separates "premium app" from "content farm."

**Asset ledger:** Create `docs/coo/visual-assets-ledger.md`. One row per image:
- Recipe slug · Stage (hero / step N) · Source (AI tool OR stock site + photographer) · Prompt summary or URL · License · Commercial use OK · Cook accuracy signoff date · Patrick replacement date (blank until he shoots own)

**Engineer integration:** Once cook signs off, engineer reads the ledger and migrates images into `seed-recipes.ts` via existing `photo_url` field on Recipe and step objects. May need new optional `image_source` field for on-device credit display.

**Sequencing:**
1. Start with **Smash Burger** — well-documented, fast feedback loop. Patrick reviews.
2. If Smash Burger lands cleanly, do **Spaghetti Carbonara** + **Roast Chicken** — high-frequency recipes, users see them first.
3. Then the remaining 13 at your pace.
4. **Don't try all 16 in one session** — sustained workstream over a week or so.

**Cost:** ~1 session per 2–3 recipes for the deep-research + generate + cook-validation loop. So roughly 6–8 sessions across a week to complete all 16.

**Blocks:** v1.0 launch visual story. Without this work, launch ships on gradient placeholders.

**Files touched:** `docs/coo/visual-assets-ledger.md` (new), `docs/coo/photography/` (working notes), eventual handoff to Engineer with image files/URLs for `seed-recipes.ts` integration.

### HANDOFF → COO · 2026-05-10 · IN PROGRESS (build #105 — Kitchen Editorial redesign + gold accent introduced)
**From:** Senior Engineer
**Subject:** Build #105 dispatched on commit `b6d0c70`. Per R-015 — shipped, awaiting Patrick on-device validation. Not self-closing.

**Token change note for the audit trail:**
The COO handoff specified migrating `tokens.gold` from `#C9A84C` to `#F2CC2A`. The codebase did **not** have a `gold` token previously — closest neighbours were `ochre` (`#C07038`, mise en place zone) and `amber` (`#1E1408` dark amber tint). No callers of `tokens.gold` existed anywhere in the mobile tree. So this commit **adds the token fresh** rather than migrating one. There is nothing to regression-scan because there were no prior callers.

```
gold:    '#F2CC2A',
goldDim: 'rgba(242,204,42,0.15)',
```

**Implementation per Designer spec:**
1. Header — day-of-week + period (`dayTimeLabel(new Date())`) above 'hone.' wordmark in Playfair 30sp; period rendered with `tokens.gold`. Avatar circle (32dp) on the right with the user initial 'P'.
2. Search — surface bg, `borderWidth: 1.5, borderColor: tokens.gold`, ingredient search behaviour preserved.
3. Hero card — 178dp, full-width, 20px radius. Picks the first planned recipe → `Tonight` gold badge + `Cook →` rust CTA. Otherwise picks the top of the active filter → cuisine name badge + `Plan +` CTA. Gradient overlay over the recipe's `hero_fallback` bands (no expo-image dependency in the hero so it always renders).
4. Category tiles — `Browse by cuisine` label, then horizontal scroll of 9 tiles (All + Levantine, Indian, Japanese, Italian, Malaysian, Thai, French, Australian — Designer-locked order). Tiles hide if no recipe in the active roster carries that cuisine. Active tile: solid gold fill + dark label. 62dp width.
5. Recipe rows — `(tabs)/index.tsx` now renders rows instead of cards. 58×58 thumbnail (gradient bands + emoji), gold cuisine tag (uppercase 9sp), Playfair title 14sp 700, meta strip (chef · time · difficulty in muted ink), Planned badge in gold-dim, chevron right.

**Removed (intentional):**
- Mode chips (All / Quick / Weekend / Favourites / Yours). Editorial spec is cuisine-only filtering. If you want quick/weekend/favourites back as a separate surface, that's a follow-up.
- 'Cooking tonight' amber banner — superseded by the hero card's 'Tonight' badge.
- Old 'What are you cooking tonight?' hero text — replaced by wordmark + day/time line.

**Visual regression scan:**
- Searched for `tokens.gold` callers across `mobile/`: zero. The new token has no upstream legacy.
- `ochre`, `amber`, `primary`, `sage` callers untouched — those tokens did not change colour.
- The Editorial direction does not yet apply to other tabs (Pantry, Shop, Plan, recipe detail). Those screens will continue rendering with their existing palette. If Patrick wants the gold accent rolled into the recipe detail eyebrow or anywhere else, that's a separate pass.

**Colour clashes to flag:** none observed in static review. The new gold reads cleanly on `tokens.cream` (card surface) and against `tokens.bg` (screen). The dark text on solid gold (`#0F1A14` literal in the active tile and goldDim badges via `tokens.gold` text) gives high contrast for the active state. Will verify on-device.

**On-device validation Patrick should walk:**
1. Open Kitchen → header reads day + time + 'hone.' with a gold period; avatar 'P' top right.
2. Search bar has a thin gold border.
3. Hero card: if a recipe is planned, hero is that recipe with 'Tonight' gold badge and 'Cook →' rust pill. If nothing is planned, hero is the top of the All filter with cuisine name as badge and 'Plan +' rust pill.
4. Tap a category tile (e.g. Italian) → it fills with solid gold; the recipe rows below filter to that cuisine. Tap All to clear.
5. Recipe rows are tight 58×58-thumb + cuisine-tag + title + meta. Ingredient search still narrows the list.
6. Tap any row or the hero → recipe detail opens as before.

**Files touched (2):** `mobile/src/theme/tokens.ts`, `mobile/app/(tabs)/index.tsx`.

**Status:** **shipped, awaiting Patrick on-device validation** per R-015. Not self-closing.

### HANDOFF → COO · 2026-05-10 · IN PROGRESS (build #104 — shop tick mirrors to pantry, carousel match counter updates)
**From:** Senior Engineer
**Subject:** Build #104 dispatched on commit `d52397f`. Per R-015 — shipped, awaiting Patrick on-device validation. Not self-closing.

**Diagnosis matched the COO hypothesis exactly:**
1. `handleToggleInCart` in `shop.tsx` only toggled `in_cart` on the shopping row — no side-effect into pantry.
2. Pantry tab's `useFocusEffect` re-fetched shopping items but not pantry items, so even if the DB were updated, the carousel stayed stale on tab return.
3. Match counters are derived from `pantryItems` state correctly — they just never saw the new ingredient.

**Fix (3 files, 1 commit):**
- `mobile/app/(tabs)/shop.tsx` — `handleToggleInCart` now also `upsertPantryItem(db, { ..., have_it: willBeInCart })`. Tick adds to pantry; untick clears `have_it` (we set false rather than delete so quantity/unit/category set elsewhere isn't clobbered, and so the pantry catalog stays whole for `initializePantryItems`' purposes).
- `mobile/src/data/pantry-helpers.ts` — `pantryId` exported (was file-private). shop.tsx needs to compute the same id so an existing pantry row is hit on UPSERT instead of a duplicate created.
- `mobile/app/(tabs)/pantry.tsx` — `useFocusEffect` now `Promise.all`s `getShoppingItems` + `getPantryItems`. Carousel match counters recompute via the existing `useMemo` on `pantryItems`.

**On-device validation Patrick should walk:**
1. Open a recipe with missing ingredients (e.g. Smash Burger when pantry is empty).
2. Tap a chip on the recipe to add the ingredient to the shopping list.
3. Go to Shop tab. Tick the item.
4. Return to Pantry tab. The recipe-match counter on the carousel for that recipe should now show that ingredient as matched, and the count should be one higher than before.
5. Go back to Shop tab. Untick the item.
6. Return to Pantry tab. The counter should drop back.

**Files touched:** 3 — `mobile/app/(tabs)/shop.tsx`, `mobile/app/(tabs)/pantry.tsx`, `mobile/src/data/pantry-helpers.ts`.

**Status:** **shipped, awaiting Patrick on-device validation** per R-015. Not self-closing.

### HANDOFF → COO · 2026-05-10 · IN PROGRESS (build #103 — R-016 root-cause fix + 3 prior items cumulative)
**From:** Senior Engineer
**Subject:** Build #103 dispatched on commit `d974880`. R-016 (the 4×-recurring "46 recipes coming back") root-caused and architecturally fixed. Per R-015 — shipped, awaiting Patrick on-device validation. Not self-closing.

**Root cause of the regression:**

The `not_yet_shipping` flag lived only in memory on each Recipe const. It was in the Zod schema and on each in-memory recipe, but **never persisted to SQLite** — no column, no INSERT, no rowToRecipe mapping, no UPDATE in `refreshSeedRecipeFields`. Every launch the DB read returned all 46 recipes with `r.not_yet_shipping === undefined`, the JS-side filter `!r.not_yet_shipping` evaluated `true` for every row, Kitchen showed all 46. Earlier "fixes" all touched the in-memory seed array — the data never reached SQLite.

**Architectural fix instead of another patch:**

1. `seed-recipes.ts` split at the source. `SEED_RECIPES` is exactly 16 launch recipes — the only array the seeder consumes. `SEED_RECIPES_HOLDING` holds the 30 (defined, never inserted). To promote one later: move its name from HOLDING into SEED_RECIPES.
2. `pruneOrphanedSeedRecipes(db)` runs every launch in `setupDatabase`. Deletes any seeded row whose id is no longer in `SEED_RECIPES`. Cleans up Patrick's existing install where the 30 holding rows still sit in SQLite from earlier seeds. ON DELETE CASCADE handles meal_plan / favorites / ingredient_swaps.
3. `getActiveRecipes` collapsed to an alias for `getAllRecipes` — the old filter was always a no-op at runtime. Kept the name so the 2 callers (Kitchen, Pantry) don't need to be touched.
4. `smokeAlarmSeedCount(db)` dev-only tripwire. After seed/sync/refresh/prune, if seeded-row count != `SEED_RECIPES.length`, `console.error` with the offending ids. Production APK silent.

**Cumulative state in build #103:**
- Item 1 (chip removal) — already in #100 (`9f53396`)
- Item 2 (Designer v2.2 polish) — already in #102 (`e663cfd`)
- Item 3 (Cook's 5 fixes) — already in #101 (`7be6b3b`)
- Item 4 (R-016 root-cause fix) — **this commit** (`d974880`, build #103)

Patrick should install build #103 — it's cumulative HEAD of main.

**On-device validation:**
1. Open Kitchen → exactly 16 cards. Force-close, reopen → still 16. **The "creep back" is gone.**
2. Open Pantry → "What I have" matching only considers the 16.
3. Deep-link to Smash Burger / Carbonara / Roast Chicken / Hummus / Flour Tortillas / Falafel still works.
4. Sanity: any meal-plan entries you set on a holding recipe (very unlikely since they were never browseable) will be cascade-deleted by the prune. Verify on-device.

**Files touched (4):** `mobile/src/data/seed-recipes.ts`, `mobile/db/seed.ts`, `mobile/db/database.ts`, `mobile/app/_layout.tsx`.

**Status:** **shipped, awaiting Patrick on-device validation** per R-015. Not self-closing.

### HANDOFF → Senior Engineer · 2026-05-10 · OPEN (Kitchen screen redesign — Editorial direction)
**From:** Product Designer
**Subject:** Redesign the Kitchen browse screen to the locked Editorial direction
**Why:** Patrick approved the Editorial layout, category tile design, gold search border, and updated gold token. This replaces the current Kitchen screen layout entirely.

**What's done:**
- Full prototype at `docs/prototypes/kitchen-editorial-v1.html` — two states (All / Levantine filtered), bottom nav, all components
- Colourway exploration at `docs/prototypes/kitchen-colourways.html` (reference only — dark sage direction confirmed)

**Locked design decisions:**

1. **Gold token updated** — `#F2CC2A` replaces `#C9A84C` throughout. Update `tokens.ts` first; everything downstream inherits it.

2. **Wordmark header** — Replace current screen title with:
   - Small day/time context line above: derive from `new Date()`, format as `{dayName} {morning/afternoon/evening}`
   - `hone.` in Playfair Display 900, lowercase, 30sp. The period is `#F2CC2A`.
   - User avatar (initial) top-right, 32dp circle, `surface2` fill

3. **Gold search border** — Search bar: `border: 1.5px solid #F2CC2A` (solid). Background stays `surface`.

4. **Category tiles** (replaces current horizontal chip row):
   - Scrollable row, each tile 62dp wide, `surface` bg, `borderRadius: 14`
   - Emoji (20sp) stacked above cuisine label (9sp, `ink2`)
   - Section label above: "Browse by cuisine" 11sp uppercase `ink2`
   - **Active: solid `#F2CC2A` fill + border, label `#0F1A14` weight 600**
   - Order: All · Levantine · Indian · Japanese · Italian · Malaysian · Thai · French · Australian
   - Tapping filters the recipe list to that cuisine

5. **Hero card** — full-width, `borderRadius: 20`, height 178dp, above category row:
   - Tonight's planned recipe if one exists; otherwise top recipe in active filter
   - Gradient overlay top→bottom (transparent to 88% dark)
   - Badge top-right: "Tonight" or cuisine name
   - Bottom: gold cuisine tag → Playfair title 19sp → chef · time strip + rust CTA pill

6. **Recipe list rows** (replaces card grid):
   - Full-width rows, `surface` bg, `borderRadius: 14`, `border: 1px solid line`
   - 58×58dp thumbnail left, `borderRadius: 10`
   - Gold cuisine tag (9sp uppercase) → Playfair title (14sp 700) → meta (chef · time · difficulty, `ink3`)
   - Chevron right. Planned badge: gold-dim. Pantry match: sage-dim.

7. **Section header** above list: recipe count right-aligned `ink3`.

**Files touched:** `mobile/src/constants/tokens.ts`, `mobile/app/(tabs)/index.tsx`, new components in `mobile/src/components/`

**Prototype:** `docs/prototypes/kitchen-editorial-v1.html`

**Blocks:** COO to sequence. `tokens.gold` change will propagate everywhere — verify no regressions on other screens before shipping.

### HANDOFF → Senior Engineer · 2026-05-09 · OPEN URGENT (build #100 — three items, one build)
**From:** Patrick (via COO)
**Subject:** Three items Patrick wants in the next build, all small, all queued. Bundle into one commit / one build.
**Why:** Patrick installed #99, portion sizing now actually shows on-device (good), but two things he's asked for previously haven't been actioned yet, plus the cook just shipped a content-disparity fix. Group them into build #100.

**What's needed:**

1. **Remove the "Scaled Nx up" chip from the recipe screen.** It still shows on-device after picking a non-default count (e.g., "Scaled 1.3x up"). The chip is meaningless — user has no baseline to compare to. The +/− stepper and the "Makes N burgers" copy already convey everything needed. Strip the chip from `mobile/app/recipe/[id].tsx` (or wherever it renders). ~5 minutes.

2. **Implement the Designer's v2.2 visual polish** per the existing handoff below ("scaling control visual polish — implement v2.2 design"). Centre cell resize to 52×40px, stack number + unit label vertically, dimmed +/− on min/max with pointerEvents:none, conditional render of extra-for-tomorrow row. Reference `docs/prototypes/recipe-detail-v2.2.html` for measurements. Designer's mockup has been waiting; ship it now. ~half a session.

3. **Apply the cook's 5-recipe content fixes** per the existing handoff below ("scaling-disparity fix"). Five recipes (SMASH_BURGER, PASTA_CARBONARA, BUTTER_CHICKEN, CHICKEN_SCHNITZEL, FLOUR_TORTILLAS) need their step content / mise text updated to remove hardcoded ingredient quantities so step copy stops lying when the user scales. Exact replacements listed in that handoff. ~30 minutes.

**Validation gate per R-015:**
- `npx tsc --noEmit` clean
- `tail -c 200` of every modified file confirms clean end of byte stream
- Engineer does NOT declare done — declares "shipped to main, awaiting Patrick on-device validation"
- Build log entry written for #100 in the table at the top of this file (per R-015 build-note rule)

**Files touched:** `mobile/app/recipe/[id].tsx` (chip removal + v2.2 wiring), `mobile/src/components/ServingsSelector.tsx` (v2.2 visual), `mobile/src/data/seed-recipes.ts` (cook's 5 recipe content fixes).

**Cost:** ~1 session combined.
**Blocks:** Patrick installing build #100 and walking the validation list.

---

### HANDOFF → Senior Engineer · 2026-05-09 · OPEN (scaling-disparity fix — remove hardcoded quantities from step content in seed-recipes.ts)
**From:** COO (Culinary Research)
**Subject:** Five recipes in seed-recipes.ts have hardcoded ingredient quantities in step `content` or `mise` fields that don't scale when the user changes serving count. Research files have been corrected — engineer applies the fixes to seed-recipes.ts.
**Why:** Step content with "Combine 200g flour..." still shows 200g at 3× scale. The ingredient list scales correctly; the step text doesn't. This is a UX lie — the user sees a scaled ingredient list, then reads a step telling them the unscaled amount.

**What's needed — exact changes to seed-recipes.ts:**

1. **SMASH_BURGER** — Step "Ball and season" `content`:
   - REMOVE: `"Divide the beef into 100g balls per patty."`
   - REPLACE WITH: `"Divide the beef into one ball per patty. Don't pack it — a loose ball smashes better than a dense one. Season the outside of each ball directly in the pan immediately before smashing, not before."`

2. **PASTA_CARBONARA** — Step "Cook pasta" `content` (whichever step reserves pasta water):
   - REMOVE: `"Reserve 200ml of pasta water before draining."`
   - REPLACE WITH: `"Reserve a generous ladleful of pasta water before draining."`

3. **BUTTER_CHICKEN** — Step "Marinate the chicken" `content` AND matching mise:
   - REMOVE all inline quantities: `"Mix yoghurt, lemon juice, 4 crushed garlic cloves, half the grated ginger, kashmiri chilli, 1 tsp garam masala, cumin, coriander, turmeric, and 1 tsp salt into a paste."`
   - REPLACE WITH: `"Combine all marinade ingredients into a paste — the yoghurt, lemon juice, crushed garlic, half the grated ginger, and all the marinade spices."`

4. **CHICKEN_SCHNITZEL** — Mise `content` (breading station setup):
   - REMOVE: `"Dish 2: 2 beaten eggs"`
   - REPLACE WITH: `"Dish 2: the beaten eggs"`
   Also Step 0 brine `content` (if present):
   - REMOVE: `"Dissolve the salt in 1 L of cold water."`
   - REPLACE WITH: `"Dissolve the salt in enough cold water to fully submerge the chicken."`

5. **FLOUR_TORTILLAS** — Step "Divide and rest" `content` AND matching mise:
   - REMOVE: `"Divide the dough into 13 pieces of ~30g each."` (or similar with "13")
   - REPLACE WITH: `"Divide the dough into one piece per tortilla, each roughly 40g."`

**Recipes confirmed CLEAN (no changes needed):** WEEKDAY_BOLOGNESE, THAI_GREEN_CURRY, BEEF_LASAGNE, ROAST_CHICKEN, ROAST_LAMB, FISH_AND_CHIPS, PAVLOVA, HUMMUS, PAD_THAI, FALAFEL, CHICKEN_SHAWARMA. All number references in these are temperatures, times, or cut sizes — not ingredient quantities.

**Files touched:** `mobile/src/data/seed-recipes.ts` (5 recipe consts)
**Reference files:** See engineer-fix notes at the bottom of each corresponding research file in `docs/coo/culinary-research/`

**Blocks:** Content accuracy guarantee for all 16 launch recipes at any serving count.

### HANDOFF → Senior Engineer · 2026-05-09 · OPEN (scaling control visual polish — implement v2.2 design)
**From:** Product Designer
**Subject:** Visual polish pass for the per-recipe scaling control — wire in the v2.2 design spec on top of the functional build shipped in `ce3ff2b`
**Why:** Per Patrick's direction, Engineer shipped the functional unit-aware scaling control first. This handoff closes the parallel design track — v2.2 prototype is done and delivers the visual treatment the functional build doesn't yet have.

**What's done:**
- `docs/prototypes/recipe-detail-v2.2.html` — full interactive prototype with:
  - 5 component states (person / burger / loaf / cup / tortilla) in singular and plural
  - Centre cell resized to 52×40px (was 28×32px) to accommodate stacked number + unit label
  - Number sits above the unit label; unit label in `var(--text-secondary)` at 11px
  - 3 interactive in-context demos (Carbonara / Smash Burger / Sourdough) with live ingredient scaling
  - 4 button states: normal, min (− dimmed at 0.28 opacity + `pointerEvents: none`), max (+ dimmed), with hint
  - "Make extra for tomorrow" reads recipe-specific `extra_for_tomorrow_label`; falls back to generic hint when absent
  - Conditional rendering: entire extra-for-tomorrow row omits when field is absent — no broken UI on old seed recipes

**What's needed:**

1. **Resize the centre cell** on `ServingsSelector.tsx` from its current dimensions to `width: 52px, height: 40px`. Stack number and unit label vertically (`flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center', justifyContent: 'center'`).
2. **Unit label row**: `fontFamily: fonts.sans, fontSize: 11, color: tokens.textSecondary, marginTop: 2`. Reads the derived unit string (`output_unit_plural ?? output_unit + 's'` or `"people"` for serve-unit recipes).
3. **Disabled-state spec**: `opacity: 0.28` + `pointerEvents: 'none'` on − when `count === 1`; same on + when `count === output_max` (if `output_max` is absent, no upper clamp).
4. **Extra-for-tomorrow row**: if `extra_for_tomorrow_label` is present on the recipe, render it verbatim. If absent, keep current generic fallback. If no `extra_for_tomorrow_label` AND no generic concept applies, omit the row entirely.
5. Reference `docs/prototypes/recipe-detail-v2.2.html` for all visual measurements. All tokens already exist in v0.7 — no new token additions required.

**Files touched:** `mobile/app/recipe/[id].tsx` (ServingsSelector usage), `mobile/src/components/ServingsSelector.tsx`

**Blocks:** v0.6.x polish milestone. Functional build is already live — this is cosmetic only, non-blocking for Patrick's on-device validation of build #96.

---

### HANDOFF → Patrick · 2026-05-08 · ON-DEVICE VALIDATION (build #96 — DECISION-014 portion-sizing live)
**From:** Senior Engineer
**Subject:** Per-recipe units shipped on `ce3ff2b`. v0.6.0 milestone work landed. Build #96 dispatched on Patrick's go.

**Commit:** `ce3ff2b` — DECISION-014 per-recipe portion units (4 launch-only files: types.ts, seed-recipes.ts, ServingsSelector.tsx, recipe/[id].tsx, RecipeCard.tsx)

**State after this commit:**
- Schema has 4 new optional fields: `output_unit`, `output_unit_plural`, `output_default`, `extra_for_tomorrow_label`. All `.optional()` — non-launch recipes untouched.
- 16 launch recipes carry their unit data verbatim from cook's `launch-recipe-units.md`.
- ServingsSelector renders "Makes 4 burgers" / "Serves 4 people" / "Makes 1 loaf" / "Makes 13 tortillas" / "Makes 2 cups" depending on the recipe.
- RecipeCard chip on the Kitchen screen reads "4 burgers" / "1 chicken" / "8 tortillas" instead of bare "4".
- Default count on recipe-open uses `output_default ?? base_servings`.
- "Make extra for tomorrow" reads recipe-specific label when authored, falls back to generic leftover hint when not.

**On-device checklist Patrick should walk:**
1. **Smash Burger** opens at "4 burgers" (not "4 people"). Stepper increments: "1 burger / 2 burgers / 3 burgers". Right side reads "Makes 4 burgers".
2. **Roast Chicken** opens at "1 chicken". Stepper goes 1 → 2 (capped UI side at 20 by the existing stepper guards). Right side reads "Makes 1 chicken".
3. **Hummus** opens at "2 cups". Stepper increments cups. Right side reads "Makes 2 cups".
4. **Flour Tortillas** opens at "13 tortillas". Right side reads "Makes 13 tortillas".
5. **Pasta Carbonara** opens at "4 serves". Right side reads "Serves 4 serves" — note: this reads slightly oddly because the unit is "serve" and the prefix becomes "Serves", giving "Serves 4 serves". If you want this to read "Serves 4 people" we'll need to set `output_unit_plural: "people"` on those recipes (or special-case the "serve" unit). Flag this if it bothers you and we'll tighten in a follow-up.
6. Tap a non-tonight leftover mode (lunch / 3-day / week). On Smash Burger the hint reads "Make only what you'll eat — smash burgers don't reheat once the crust softens" instead of the generic "+1 portion per person — tomorrow's lunch sorted." Verify recipe-specific labels surface correctly on butter chicken, bolognese, hummus.
7. **Kitchen browse cards**: each card's meta chip should show the unit ("4 burgers", "1 chicken") instead of just "4".
8. **Non-launch recipes** (e.g., open via deep link to `chicken-adobo`): should fall back to legacy "people / portions" rendering, no errors.

**Designer parallel handoff:** still open below. Designer is producing the visual treatment for the new scaling control. This shipped commit is the functional version per Patrick's "ship functional first" direction. Visual polish lands as a follow-up commit.

**Issue that needs your call:** the "Serves 4 serves" oddity above. Three options:
- (a) Special-case unit==='serve' to render right-side caption as "people" (so it reads "Serves 4 people"). Cleanest UX but a magic string in the UI.
- (b) Update each cook-spec recipe's `output_unit_plural` to "people" for the serve-unit recipes (so it reads "Serves 4 people"). Data-driven.
- (c) Leave as-is. "Serves 4 serves" is grammatically valid even if it reads odd.

I recommend (a) — it's a 2-line code change and keeps the cook's spec verbatim. Confirm preference and I'll ship it as a small follow-on.

**Per CLAUDE.md:** GitHub issue NOT closed. Patrick validates on-device and closes himself.

### HANDOFF → Senior Engineer · 2026-05-08 · DONE ✅ (portion-sizing redesign — recipe-aware units per Cook's spec)
**Closed by Senior Engineer 2026-05-08 in commit `ce3ff2b`.** All five sub-tasks landed:
- Schema additions (4 fields, all optional)
- 16 launch recipes migrated from cook's launch-recipe-units.md
- ServingsSelector rebuilt with recipe-aware copy + recipe-aware mode hint
- recipe/[id].tsx wires the new props + uses output_default for first-render count
- RecipeCard meta chip on Kitchen surface uses the per-recipe unit

Backwards-compatible: non-launch recipes fall back to legacy "people / portions" rendering. tsc clean. Brace/paren balance 0.

### Original handoff (preserved for audit) → Senior Engineer · 2026-05-08 · OPEN URGENT (portion-sizing redesign — recipe-aware units per Cook's spec)
**From:** Patrick (via COO)
**Subject:** Replace the generic "Servings = N people" scaling model with per-recipe units (burger / loaf / cup / person / item) per Cook's `launch-recipe-units.md`
**Why:** The current scaling math is wrong because it treats every recipe as if "servings" means "people." Burgers are per-person, hummus is by cup, sourdough is one loaf regardless, tortillas are per-tortilla. Cook has authored the per-recipe unit spec at `docs/coo/culinary-research/launch-recipe-units.md` — engineer needs to wire it into the schema and the scaling UI. Cook owns the chef knowledge; engineer owns the math that respects it (per DECISION-007).

**What's needed:**

1. **Schema additions** to `mobile/src/data/types.ts` Recipe Zod schema. Additive only:
   - `output_unit: z.string()` — e.g., `"burger"`, `"loaf"`, `"cup"`, `"person"`, `"tortilla"`, `"piece"`, `"batch"`
   - `output_unit_plural: z.string().optional()` — e.g., `"burgers"`, `"loaves"`, `"cups"`, `"people"`, `"tortillas"`. If omitted, default to `output_unit + "s"`.
   - `output_default: z.number().int().positive()` — sensible default count for one batch (e.g., 4 burgers, 1 loaf, 8 tortillas, 4 people)
   - `extra_for_tomorrow_label: z.string().optional()` — what tapping "Make extra for tomorrow" actually does for THIS recipe (e.g., `"+1 extra burger"`, `"Double the batch"`, `"+4 extra tortillas"`). If omitted, default to `+1 ${output_unit}`.

2. **Migrate the 16 launch recipes' values from Cook's spec.** Read `docs/coo/culinary-research/launch-recipe-units.md`, populate the four new fields per recipe in `seed-recipes.ts`. The 29 not-yet-shipping recipes can stay with sensible defaults for now; cook handles them in v1.1.

3. **Rebuild the scaling control on `mobile/app/recipe/[id].tsx`.** Replace "Servings: 4" with `"Makes ${count} ${output_unit_plural}"` (or `"Serves ${count} ${output_unit_plural}"` when `output_unit === "person"`). The +/− stepper adjusts count, ingredients re-scale per existing `scales` flag + `scaling_note`. UI label updates dynamically: "Makes 4 burgers" → "Makes 6 burgers" → "Makes 8 burgers."

4. **Make "Make extra for tomorrow" recipe-aware.** Read `extra_for_tomorrow_label` for the recipe; if absent, fall back to `+1 ${output_unit}`. Stop the current generic-leftover behaviour that just adds one person.

5. **Designer handoff is in flight in parallel** (separate handoff below). Coordinate with Designer on the visual treatment of the new scaling control once their mockup lands. Don't block engineering on designer — ship the functional version first; restyle in a second pass if needed.

**Files touched:** `mobile/src/data/types.ts`, `mobile/src/data/seed-recipes.ts`, `mobile/app/recipe/[id].tsx`, possibly the Pantry recipe-match-card if it shows serving info.

**Cost:** ~1 session.

**Validation gate:**
- `npx tsc --noEmit` clean
- Recipe screen shows correct unit per recipe — burger says burgers, sourdough says loaf, hummus says cups
- Scaling math respects existing `scales` and `scaling_note` per ingredient
- "Make extra for tomorrow" produces the right delta per recipe
- All 16 launch recipes verified on-device

**Blocks:** v0.6.0 milestone (per DECISION-012, v0.6.0 marks "portion-sizing redesign live").

---

### HANDOFF → Product Designer · 2026-05-08 · DONE ✅ (portion-sizing visual treatment — new scaling control)
**Closed by Product Designer 2026-05-09 — `docs/prototypes/recipe-detail-v2.2.html` delivered. Implementation handoff issued above (→ Senior Engineer · 2026-05-09).**

**From:** Patrick (via COO)
**Subject:** Design the new per-recipe scaling control to display the right unit per recipe ("Makes 4 burgers" / "Makes 1 loaf" / "Serves 4 people")
**Why:** The current "Servings = 4" component on the recipe-detail screen treats every recipe identically. Engineer is migrating the schema and logic per Cook's spec; you need to design how the new scaling reads on-screen.

**What's needed:**

1. Update or extend `docs/prototypes/recipe-detail-v2.html` (or a new `recipe-detail-v2.2.html`) showing the scaling control across these recipe types:
   - **Person-scaled** ("Serves 4 people" — bolognese, butter chicken, carbonara, lamb)
   - **Item-scaled** ("Makes 4 burgers" — smash burger, schnitzel)
   - **Loaf-scaled** ("Makes 1 loaf" — sourdough)
   - **Cup/batch-scaled** ("Makes 2 cups" — hummus, sauces)
   - **Piece-scaled** ("Makes 8 tortillas" — flour tortillas)

2. The control still has a +/− stepper; the *label* changes per recipe.

3. The "Make extra for tomorrow" toggle/button should display the recipe-specific label (Engineer is wiring the data: `extra_for_tomorrow_label`). Show how this reads: `"+1 lunch tomorrow"` for person-scaled, `"+1 extra burger"` for burgers, `"Double the batch"` for hummus, etc.

4. **Constraint:** v0.7 dark sage tokens locked. No visual direction change — same surfaces, same gold accent, same Inter/Playfair type. Just relabel the control honestly.

5. Engineer handoff block at the bottom of the prototype — implementation notes, conditional rendering rules, accessibility labels.

**Files touched:** `docs/prototypes/recipe-detail-v2.html` (update) or `docs/prototypes/recipe-detail-v2.2.html` (new).

**Cost:** ~half a session.

**Coordination:** Engineer's handoff (above) is in flight in parallel. They will ship the functional version first; your visual treatment lands as a polish pass on top. Don't be blocked on Engineer; ship the mockup at your own pace.

**Blocks:** Engineer's polish pass on the scaling control. Functional version ships without you.

### HANDOFF → Patrick · 2026-05-08 · ON-DEVICE VALIDATION (build #95 — five fixes incl. v0.5.0 bump, smash-burger sauce split, Equipment redesign, CHICKEN_SHAWARMA, DECISION-013 launch scope)
**From:** Senior Engineer
**Subject:** Five-commit package on `4c4daf9`; build #95 dispatched on Patrick's go.

**Commits:**
- `08529ff` — chore(version): bump to v0.5.0 per DECISION-012
- `a03f0e1` — fix(seed): SMASH_BURGER — burger sauce split into mayo + ketchup + mustard (Patrick on-device 8 May: compound name landed as one shop-list row)
- `f8a4750` — feat(recipe): Equipment as vertical wrap pill list (was horizontal scroll). Recommended over collapsible dropdown — zero-tap, consistent with Prep section, no Android gesture conflict
- `d7c7c5a` — feat(seed): CHICKEN_SHAWARMA new recipe (replaces lamb in v1.0 launch slot per Patrick 8 May)
- `4c4daf9` — feat(seed,ui): DECISION-013 — `not_yet_shipping` flag + filter 30 non-launch recipes; FLOUR_TORTILLAS chef = 'Patrick Nasr'

**State on origin/main after this batch:**
- App version: 0.5.0
- Recipes total: 46 (added CHICKEN_SHAWARMA; LAMB_SHAWARMA stays as not_yet_shipping)
- Recipes user-visible in v1.0: 16 (the launch-16 from DECISION-013)
- Recipes with full DECISION-008 sections: 45 of 46 (sourdough-maintenance still empty by intent — placeholder renders)
- Build #95 queued: https://github.com/patrickpatches/hone/actions/runs/25532238312

**On-device checks Patrick should walk through after the APK lands:**

For DECISION-013 (launch-scope):
1. Kitchen browse — exactly 16 recipes visible. No CHICKEN_ADOBO, no FALAFEL, no KAFTA, no LAMB_SHAWARMA.
2. Search "rendang" → no results (not_yet_shipping).
3. Pantry-match — only suggests from the 16. Even if pantry contains lamb + chickpeas, lamb-shawarma and falafel won't appear.

For SMASH_BURGER:
4. Open Smash Burger → 'Plan this recipe' → switch to Shop tab. Should see three separate items: Mayonnaise, Tomato ketchup, American (yellow) mustard. NOT a single 'Burger sauce (mayo + ketchup + mustard)' row.
5. Tap Mayonnaise on the recipe screen → substitution sheet should show Kewpie + Aioli swaps.

For Equipment UX:
6. Open any recipe with Equipment populated. Should show a vertical wrap of pills, NOT a horizontal side-scroll.
7. Items wrap onto 2-3 lines naturally. Smash Burger (4 items) likely fits 1 line; Beef Wellington (7 items) wraps to 2-3.

For CHICKEN_SHAWARMA:
8. Open chicken-shawarma. Title should read 'Home Oven Chicken Shawarma'. Total time 150 min. Method has 5 steps including "Marinate (2 hours, ideally overnight)". Equipment shows 4 items. Prep shows 7 items.

For FLOUR_TORTILLAS:
9. Open Soft Buttery Flour Tortillas. Source attribution should read 'Patrick Nasr', not 'Hone Kitchen'. Notes: "Patrick's own recipe — soft, buttery, adapted over time from multiple sources."

For v0.5.0 version bump:
10. Settings (or wherever app version is displayed) should show 0.5.0 not 0.4.1.

**Per CLAUDE.md:** GitHub issues NOT closed. Patrick validates on-device and closes himself.

### HANDOFF → Senior Engineer · 2026-05-08 · DONE ✅ (DECISION-013 — scope build to 16 launch recipes; tag the rest)
**Closed by Senior Engineer 2026-05-08 in commit `4c4daf9`.** All five sub-tasks landed:
- Schema field `not_yet_shipping?: boolean` added to types.ts (optional, not default(false), so launch-set recipes don't need explicit declarations)
- `getActiveRecipes(db)` helper added to db/database.ts
- 30 non-launch recipes flagged (was 29 in handoff; +1 = CHICKEN_VEG_STIR_FRY which the handoff's "plus any others not in the launch 16" caught)
- Kitchen browse + Pantry match wired through getActiveRecipes
- Shop tab kept on getAllRecipes (lookup map for meal-plan source breakdowns; recipes already in plans must still resolve)
- FLOUR_TORTILLAS chef = 'Patrick Nasr', source.notes updated, video_url removed

### HANDOFF → Senior Engineer · 2026-05-08 · DONE ✅ (CHICKEN_SHAWARMA — new recipe required for v1.0 launch slot)
**Closed by Senior Engineer 2026-05-08 in commit `d7c7c5a`.** New CHICKEN_SHAWARMA const created using cook's research file (chicken-shawarma.md, committed by COO in 6dbbe8e) as content source. Inserted directly after LAMB_SHAWARMA in the seed file and the SEED_RECIPES export array. LAMB_SHAWARMA flagged `not_yet_shipping: true` in commit `4c4daf9` (DECISION-013 batch). Method: 5 steps, 21 ingredients, full DECISION-008 sections. Cultural tag: levantine + chicken.

### HANDOFF → Senior Engineer · 2026-05-08 · DONE ✅ (DECISION-012 — bump version to v0.5.0 on next push)
**Closed by Senior Engineer 2026-05-08 in commit `08529ff`.** Single line change in mobile/app.json: expo.version "0.4.1" → "0.5.0". No other changes.

---

### HANDOFF → Senior Engineer · 2026-05-08 · OPEN URGENT — superseded by DONE entry above (DECISION-013 — scope build to 16 launch recipes; tag the rest)
**From:** Patrick (via COO)
**Subject:** Add `not_yet_shipping` schema flag, tag 29 non-launch recipes, ensure Patrick's flour tortilla attribution is correct
**Why:** Per DECISION-013 (decision-log.md, 8 May), v1.0 ships with 16 specific recipes only. The other 29 stay in the seed file but must be hidden from the build. Patrick's own flour tortilla recipe is the 16th and needs attribution set to him.

**The 16 launch recipes (everything else gets `not_yet_shipping: true`):**
1. Roast Chicken
2. Spaghetti Bolognese
3. Spaghetti Carbonara
4. Butter Chicken
5. Smash Burger
6. Thai Green Curry
7. Chicken Schnitzel
8. Beef Lasagne
9. Roast Lamb with Rosemary & Garlic
10. Fish & Chips
11. Pan-Fried Fish (Barramundi)
12. Pavlova
13. **Chicken** Shawarma (NOT lamb — separate handoff already open to create CHICKEN_SHAWARMA const)
14. Hummus
15. Pad Thai
16. **Soft Buttery Flour Tortillas — Patrick's recipe**

**What's needed:**
1. Add `not_yet_shipping: z.boolean().default(false)` to the Recipe Zod schema in `mobile/src/data/types.ts`. Additive only.
2. In `mobile/src/data/seed-recipes.ts`, set `not_yet_shipping: true` on every recipe NOT in the 16 above (29 recipes — `LAMB_SHAWARMA`, `MUSAKHAN`, `KAFTA`, `FATTOUSH`, `MUJADARA`, `RISOTTO`, `RAMEN`, `SCRAMBLED_EGGS`, `AGLIO_E_OLIO`, `DAL`, `EGG_FRIED_RICE`, `NASI_LEMAK`, `BEEF_RENDANG`, `CURRY_LAKSA`, `CHAR_KWAY_TEOW`, `SAAG_PANEER`, `CHICKEN_KATSU`, `TOM_YUM`, `CHICKEN_ADOBO`, `BEEF_STEW`, `SOURDOUGH_LOAF`, `SOURDOUGH_MAINTENANCE`, `FRENCH_ONION_SOUP`, `BRAISED_SHORT_RIBS`, `BEEF_WELLINGTON`, `SHEET_PAN_HARISSA_CHICKEN`, `PRAWN_TACOS_PINEAPPLE`, `FISH_TACOS`, plus any others not in the launch 16). The 16 launch recipes default to `false` — leave them unset or explicit `false`.
3. Update browse, search, and pantry-match queries to filter `WHERE not_yet_shipping = false` (or equivalent). Hidden from all user-visible surfaces in v1.0.
4. **Patrick's flour tortillas (FLOUR_TORTILLAS const):**
   - `chef`: `"Patrick Nasr"`
   - `source.notes`: `"Patrick's own recipe — soft, buttery, adapted over time from multiple sources"`
   - `source.video_url`: `null`
   - The cook's existing `docs/coo/culinary-research/flour-tortillas.md` is the structural template. Content alignment with Patrick's actual recipe is a separate cook handoff (Patrick provides his ingredient ratios and technique; cook re-formats to 10-section template).
   - Mark FLOUR_TORTILLAS as `not_yet_shipping: false` so it ships in v1.0.

**Files touched:** `mobile/src/data/types.ts`, `mobile/src/data/seed-recipes.ts`, `mobile/app/(tabs)/index.tsx` (Kitchen browse query), `mobile/app/(tabs)/pantry.tsx` (match query), `mobile/db/database.ts` if queries live there.
**Cost:** ~30 minutes for schema + tagging + query updates.
**Blocks:** v1.0 launch scope. Until this lands, the build still shows all 45 recipes to users.

### HANDOFF → Culinary Verifier · 2026-05-08 · OPEN (Patrick's flour tortilla recipe — content alignment)
**From:** Patrick (via COO)
**Subject:** Re-author `docs/coo/culinary-research/flour-tortillas.md` to match Patrick's actual recipe with him as the chef
**Why:** Per DECISION-013, Patrick's own flour tortilla recipe is the 16th launch recipe. The current `flour-tortillas.md` research file you wrote in Batch 2/3 may have used a different chef attribution or source. Patrick is the chef-of-record now: it's his recipe, learnt and tweaked from multiple sources over time.
**What's needed:**
1. Open `docs/coo/culinary-research/flour-tortillas.md`.
2. Update the Hero section: `chef: Patrick Nasr`. `source.notes`: "Patrick's own recipe — soft, buttery, adapted over time from multiple sources." `source.video_url`: null.
3. Patrick will provide his actual ingredient ratios and technique notes in a follow-up message in this chat. Reformat his input to the 10-section template (Hero / At a glance / Description / What to know before you start / Equipment / Ingredients / Prep / Cook steps / Finishing & tasting / Leftovers & storage).
4. Apply your pre-flight checklist before declaring it ready — ingredient/step parity, hidden time accounted for, doneness cues on every step, scaling annotations populated, Australian English throughout.
5. Add an entry to `docs/coo/culinary-research/launch-recipe-units.md` for tortillas: unit = "tortilla", default = 8, "make extra" = "+N tortillas".
**Files touched:** `docs/coo/culinary-research/flour-tortillas.md`, `docs/coo/culinary-research/launch-recipe-units.md`
**Blocks:** Engineer's flour tortilla migration into seed-recipes.ts (so FLOUR_TORTILLAS can ship in v1.0)

### HANDOFF → Senior Engineer · 2026-05-08 · OPEN (CHICKEN_SHAWARMA — new recipe required for v1.0 launch slot)
**From:** Culinary & Cultural Verifier
**Subject:** Author `CHICKEN_SHAWARMA` recipe const; flag `LAMB_SHAWARMA` as not yet shipping
**Why:** Patrick confirmed 2026-05-08 that the v1.0 launch slot is chicken shawarma, not lamb. The library currently has `LAMB_SHAWARMA` only. A new recipe needs to be created.
**What's done:** Portion sizing spec is locked in `docs/coo/culinary-research/launch-recipe-units.md` (section 13). `LAMB_SHAWARMA` stays in the seed file but must be flagged `not_yet_shipping` — it is a v1.2 candidate.
**What's needed:**
1. Create a new `CHICKEN_SHAWARMA` recipe const in `seed-recipes.ts`. Use the existing `LAMB_SHAWARMA` recipe object as the structural template — replace lamb with boneless chicken thighs, update marinade ratios, adjust cook time to 25–30 min at 220°C, update attribution.
2. Set `LAMB_SHAWARMA` status to `not_yet_shipping` (or remove from the launch set — whichever the schema supports).
3. Culinary Verifier will need to author a full DECISION-009 research file for `CHICKEN_SHAWARMA` before it can pass the pre-flight checklist — create a skeleton `.md` file at `docs/coo/culinary-research/chicken-shawarma.md` as a placeholder so the Verifier knows it's needed.
**Files touched:** `mobile/src/data/seed-recipes.ts`, `docs/coo/culinary-research/launch-recipe-units.md`
**Blocks:** DECISION-009 migration for the shawarma slot; photography scheduling

### HANDOFF → Senior Engineer · 2026-05-08 · OPEN (DECISION-012 — bump version to v0.5.0 on next push)
**From:** Patrick (via COO)
**Subject:** Set `version` in `mobile/app.json` to `"0.5.0"` on the next commit. Adopt new versioning policy.
**Why:** Per DECISION-012 (decision-log.md, 8 May), `v1.0.0` is reserved for Play Store production launch day. Pre-launch we use v0.x. Only the COO bumps minor versions — engineer continues to bump patches and build numbers freely. Current state has shipped enough to justify a retroactive bump from `0.4.1` to `0.5.0` to mark the Pantry v3/v4 + dark/sage palettes + Kitchen improvements + recipe template skeleton package.
**What's needed:**
1. In `mobile/app.json`, change `expo.version` from `"0.4.1"` to `"0.5.0"`. No other code changes.
2. `expo.android.versionCode` (the build number) keeps auto-incrementing as normal — that's separate.
3. Going forward: do NOT auto-bump the minor version on your own. Bug-fix patches go `0.5.0 → 0.5.1 → 0.5.2`. Minor bumps (`0.5.x → 0.6.0`) only happen on explicit COO instruction. The milestone map is in DECISION-012.
4. Commit message: `chore(version): bump to v0.5.0 per DECISION-012`.
**Files touched:** `mobile/app.json` only.
**Cost:** ~5 minutes.
**Blocks:** Nothing. Land alongside any other build.

### HANDOFF → Patrick · 2026-05-08 · ON-DEVICE VALIDATION (three jobs landed, awaiting your install)
**From:** Senior Engineer
**Subject:** ATTR-FAIL + 11-recipe DECISION-009 + 27-recipe Batch 3+4 + audit placeholder all on origin/main; build not triggered per CLAUDE.md.
**Commits:**
- `ee111a0` — ATTR-FAIL: 16 broken attribution URLs converted to book citations
- `5ac153b` — DECISION-009 Batch 2 (11 launch-priority recipes)
- `e649f0f` — DECISION-009 Batch 3+4 (27 cook-extras)
- `c5f6a2d` — UI placeholder for the one remaining empty recipe (sourdough-maintenance)

**State after all four commits:**
- 44 of 45 seed recipes carry full DECISION-008 sections (Equipment, Prep, Before-you-start, Finishing, Leftovers, total/active timings)
- 1 still empty: `sourdough-maintenance` — intentional, it's a starter-feeder guide, not a meal recipe; renders the new "Equipment and prep notes are coming" placeholder
- Zero broken attribution URLs in `seed-recipes.ts`
- Zero `whole_food_verified` references anywhere outside historical session reports

**On-device checks Patrick should walk through after triggering a build:**
1. Open chicken-adobo (now book-cited "Anthony Bourdain, No Reservations Philippines" with no URL) — Equipment, Prep, Finishing, Leftovers should render
2. Open butter-chicken — total time should read 270 min (4h 30m, including the 4-hour marinade) instead of the previous understated 90
3. Open roast-chicken — total time should read 840 min (14h, dry-brine overnight) instead of 90
4. Open lamb-shawarma — Prep checklist should be tappable, count should tick
5. Open sourdough-maintenance — should show the sage-tinted "Equipment and prep notes are coming" placeholder, NOT empty space
6. Open carbonara — `Watch the original` button should still work (the URL was already clean)

**Per CLAUDE.md:** GitHub issue NOT closed. Patrick validates on-device and closes himself.

**Build trigger:** Patrick decides when. The fixes are stacked on top of `4725618` (REGN-006 + REGN-007 fix that was last built as #92/#93). A new build dispatched on `c5f6a2d` will carry everything since the last validated APK.

### HANDOFF → Senior Engineer · 2026-05-08 · DONE ✅ (ATTR-FAIL — 16 broken attribution URLs fixed)
**Closed by Senior Engineer 2026-05-08 in commit `ee111a0`.** All 16 recipes converted to book citations per Patrick's default. Andy Cooks recipes (PRAWN_TACOS_PINEAPPLE, WEEKDAY_BOLOGNESE) used 'inspired by, no URL' framing because Andy Cooks doesn't have a published book. No video_url remains broken in seed-recipes.ts. Patrick validates on-device.

### Original handoff (preserved for audit) → Senior Engineer · 2026-05-08 · OPEN (ATTR-FAIL — fix 16 broken attribution URLs in seed-recipes.ts)
**From:** Culinary & Cultural Verifier
**Subject:** 16 recipes have `video_url` values that violate Golden Rule 1 — fix before any recipe ships
**Why:** The full attribution audit (`docs/coo/culinary-audit.md`, 2026-05-08) found 16 of 45 seed recipes link to a channel homepage, site root, about page, or chef listing page — none of which point to a specific recipe. Under Golden Rule 1, every chef-attributed link must be live and point to the specific recipe, not a channel or site. None of these recipes can ship until the link is correct or the attribution is reframed as a book citation / "inspired by" with no URL.
**What's needed:**
For each recipe below, either:
(a) Find the specific YouTube `watch?v=` video or specific recipe page URL and update `video_url` in `seed-recipes.ts`, OR
(b) Change attribution to a book citation format — update `source.notes` to include the book title, and remove or null `video_url`. The `chef` field stays as-is.

| Recipe const | Chef | Current broken URL | Fix type |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CHICKEN_ADOBO` | Anthony Bourdain / No Reservations | `@AnthonyBourdainPartsUnknown` (channel + wrong show) | Find No Reservations Philippines clip or use book citation |
| `BEEF_STEW` | Jacques Pépin | `/c/HomeCookingwithJacquesPepin` (channel) | Find specific beef stew episode on that channel |
| `ROAST_CHICKEN` | Thomas Keller / Bouchon | `@ChefThomasKeller` (channel) | Find specific roast chicken video or use Bouchon book citation |
| `PRAWN_TACOS_PINEAPPLE` | Andy Cooks | `@andy_cooks` (channel) | Find specific prawn taco/pineapple video |
| `FRENCH_ONION_SOUP` | Anthony Bourdain / Les Halles | `@AnthonyBourdainPartsUnknown` (channel + wrong show) | Find Les Halles video or use *Les Halles Cookbook* citation |
| `SCRAMBLED_EGGS` | Gordon Ramsay | `@GordonRamsay` (channel) | The F Word scrambled eggs clip is widely available — find `watch?v=` |
| `WEEKDAY_BOLOGNESE` | Andy Cooks | `@andy_cooks` (channel) | Find specific bolognese video |
| `MUSAKHAN` | Reem Kassis / The Palestinian Table | `reemkassis.com/` (site root) | Find specific musakhan page or use *The Palestinian Table* book citation |
| `KAFTA` | Anissa Helou / Feast | `anissas.com/` (site root) | Find specific kafta page or use *Feast* book citation |
| `HUMMUS` | Reem Kassis / The Palestinian Table | `reemkassis.com/` (site root) | Find specific hummus page or use *The Palestinian Table* book citation |
| `FATTOUSH` | Anissa Helou / Lebanese Cuisine | `anissas.com/` (site root) | Find specific fattoush page or use *Lebanese Cuisine* book citation |
| `SOURDOUGH_MAINTENANCE` | Chad Robertson / Tartine Bakery | `tartinebakery.com/about` (about page) | Find specific video or use *Tartine Bread* book citation |
| `SOURDOUGH_LOAF` | Chad Robertson / Tartine Bakery | `tartinebakery.com/about` (about page) | Find specific video or use *Tartine Bread* book citation |
| `RISOTTO` | Marcella Hazan | `giulianohazan.com/` (site root — also Giuliano's site, not Marcella's) | Find specific mushroom risotto page or use *Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking* book citation |
| `RAMEN` | Ivan Orkin / Ivan Ramen | `ivanramen.com/` (site root) | Find specific recipe page or use *Ivan Ramen* book citation |
| `DAL` | Madhur Jaffrey | `thehappyfoodie.co.uk/chefs/madhur-jaffrey/` (chef listing page) | Find specific tarka dal page on Happy Foodie or use *Madhur Jaffrey's Curry Easy* book citation |

**Also flag for review:** `BEEF_LASAGNE` — the URL `https://www.nytimes.com/recipes/12869/marcella-hazans-bolognese-meat-sauce.html` is a specific page (PASS) but it links to a Bolognese sauce recipe, not a lasagne. The attribution notes should clarify: "Sauce adapted from Marcella Hazan's bolognese; assembled as lasagne — Hone Kitchen." Update `source.notes` accordingly.

**Files touched:** `mobile/src/data/seed-recipes.ts` — `source.video_url` and `source.notes` fields only. No step or ingredient changes.
**Full audit detail:** `docs/coo/culinary-audit.md` — per-recipe attribution notes with context on each failure.
**Blocks:** All 16 affected recipes from shipping. This is a brand-safety issue, not just a QA item.

### HANDOFF → COO · 2026-05-07 · DONE ✅ (Cook briefed in writing — engineer unblocked for 11-recipe migration)
**Closed by COO 2026-05-07.** Cook's brief at `docs/coo/specialists/culinary-verifier.md` now carries an explicit "RETIRED FIELDS — DO NOT USE" section at the top of "How you work," naming `whole_food_verified` and instructing zero use in any new research file. A session-end `grep -i "whole_food..."` check has been added to the cook's "At session end" ritual so any drift is caught before close. Patrick is sending the cook a paste-back to acknowledge directly. Engineer cleared to proceed with the 11-recipe migration.

### Original handoff (preserved for audit) → COO · 2026-05-07 · OPEN URGENT (brief the Cook — whole-food field is dead)
**From:** Patrick (via Senior Engineer)
**Subject:** The cook's research database had whole-food references throughout. Engineer cleaned them. Cook must be told to never use the term again.
**Why:** The `whole_food_verified` field was retired across the entire repo on 2026-05-07 (commits `21198e5` + `474f500`). When the engineer ran the cleanup, fifteen of the sixteen recipe research files in `docs/coo/culinary-research/` still had a "Whole-food claim:" or "Whole-food verified:" line in their audit sections — the cook had been adding it as a standard audit checkbox. The lines have been stripped, but if the cook keeps following the old pattern, the term will leak back in next time research lands. Patrick's words: he wants this fully addressed before the 11-recipe migration proceeds, so we don't ship an APK with the term re-introduced through a new research file.

**What's already done (Engineer):**
- Stripped 15 `Whole-food claim:` / `Whole-food verified:` lines from the cook's research files in `docs/coo/culinary-research/`. Smash-burger left intentionally as the retirement narrative.
- Verified `docs/coo/culinary-research/TEMPLATE.md` (the cook's template) is clean — no mention there.
- Verified `docs/coo/specialists/culinary-verifier.md` (the cook's brief) is clean — Patrick had already cleaned this earlier.
- Schema, seed data, SQLite column, prototypes, BUGS.md, command-centre.md, roadmap.md, handoffs.md — all stripped. Only the URGENT handoff and the smash-burger retirement narrative still mention it, both deliberately.

**What's needed (COO actions):**
1. **Brief the Cook explicitly:** the whole-food concept is retired. Don't add `whole_food_verified` to any new recipe data. Don't include a "Whole-food claim" or "Whole-food verified" line in the audit section of new research files.
2. **Update the cook's standing brief if needed.** The current `docs/coo/specialists/culinary-verifier.md` is clean — confirm no follow-up edits required, or add an explicit "do not use" note if you think the cook needs the reminder in writing.
3. **Confirm to Senior Engineer when done** so the 11-recipe migration can proceed without risk of re-introducing the term through new research files.
4. **Future-proof:** consider adding a one-line check to the cook's session-end checklist — `grep "whole_food" docs/coo/culinary-research/<new-file>.md` should return zero hits.
