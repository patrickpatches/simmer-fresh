# CLAUDE.md — Standing Instructions

> This file is the source of truth for the Hone project. It is read every session. Keep it current.

## What this project is

**Hone** — a recipe and meal planning app shipping to the **Google Play Store**. Android-first; iOS is out of scope for v1.

The product POV: **the app is a calm, intuitive head chef who guides you from fridge to plate** — shopping list, prep, cooking, plating, and cleanup cues, all in one consistent voice. Not a recipe library with a timer bolted on.

**Competitive target:** beat Supercook and Yummly on three axes:
1. **Ease of use** — fewer taps, less friction, no discovery maze
2. **Australian audience** — metric only, Australian ingredient names (capsicum not bell pepper, coriander not cilantro), seasonal awareness for the Southern Hemisphere, locally available produce and proteins
3. **Recipe presentation** — chef-inspired with attribution, whole-food only (no preservatives), stage-by-stage photos of real food

The core user loop is: **pick a dish → gather ingredients → prep → cook → plate → eat.** Every screen serves one of those stages.

## Roles

- **Patrick** — CEO and owner. GitHub: `patrickpatches`. His name and identity are on all accounts (Play Console, EAS, GitHub). He tests the app, gives direction, and makes final calls. He does not write code.
- **Claude** — the entire dev team: project manager, developer, UX researcher, design psychologist, and interaction designer. Claude explains every decision, maintains this file, manages the build pipeline, and leaves a testable checkpoint after every meaningful unit of work.

## The 6 Golden Rules (non-negotiable)

1. **Research-backed UX and ergonomics.** Every UX decision must have a reason grounded in cognitive load, motor ergonomics, or proven interaction patterns. If it can't be justified, it doesn't ship.
2. **Credit the source chefs.** Recipes are inspired by and attributed to Andy Cooks, Joshua Weissman, Gordon Ramsay, Anthony Bourdain, and others. Full attribution with links to original videos. No stealing, no laundering ideas without credit.
3. **Smart scaling.** Ingredients scale by number of people, with leftover-aware proportions. A recipe for "4 people with lunch leftovers tomorrow" should produce exactly that, not just 1.25x everything.
4. **User-added recipes.** Users can add and edit their own recipes using the same structured format the app uses internally.
5. **Stage-by-stage visuals.** Real photos of what the food should look like at each step. No glamour-shot-only recipe cards. No AI-generated photos ever.
6. **Honest about limitations.** No fluff, no pretending. If a substitution changes the dish, explain how. If an ingredient is hard to find in Australia, flag it and suggest the local equivalent.

## Whole-food rule (non-negotiable)

**Every recipe uses whole, unprocessed ingredients only. No preservatives.** This means:
- Fresh herbs, not bottled pastes
- Real stocks, not stock cubes (or specify a quality brand as a fallback, with a note on flavour impact)
- No recipes that rely on processed sauces, packaged seasoning mixes, or preserved shortcuts
- If a traditionally preserved ingredient is required (e.g. miso, fish sauce, preserved lemon), it must be the real thing and be called out explicitly

## Ingredient substitutions (core feature)

Every ingredient in every recipe carries a `substitutions[]` array. Each substitution entry includes:
- The alternative ingredient
- What changes about the dish (flavour, texture, appearance)
- Whether it's a good swap or a compromise

Displayed in the app as a dropdown on each ingredient line. This is a direct competitive advantage over Yummly and Supercook.

## Shopping list (core feature)

From any recipe (or multi-recipe meal plan), users can generate a shopping list:
- Grouped by supermarket aisle category (produce, meat/seafood, pantry, dairy, bakery)
- Scaled to the serving count the user selected
- Items the user already owns can be checked off
- List is exportable / shareable
- Australian product context: flag anything that may be hard to find outside major cities and suggest a substitute

## Recipe categories (world-class taxonomy)

Categories are dual-axis: **cuisine/origin** AND **protein/type**, so users can browse either way.

**Cuisine categories:**
- Levantine — Lebanese, Syrian, Jordanian, Palestinian dishes. **No Israeli-labelled recipes.**
- Indian — North and South Indian, broken into subcategories when the library is large enough
- Malaysian
- Japanese
- Thai
- Italian
- French
- American (burgers, BBQ, Southern)
- Australian (modern Australian, indigenous-inspired where appropriate and researched)
- Mexican

**Type/protein categories:**
- Burgers
- Chicken
- Seafood
- Beef
- Lamb
- Vegetarian
- Pasta & Noodles
- Soups & Stews
- Salads
- Baking & Bread

Search must support: free-text, category filter, prep time filter, and "what I have" (pantry-first mode). Search relevance is tuned for Australian ingredient names first.

## The chef-guide voice

- **Second-person, present-tense.** "Get the pan screaming hot — you want it just starting to smoke."
- **Anticipation, not reaction.** Tell the user what's coming two steps ahead.
- **Doneness cues over times.** The timer is a safety net, not the source of truth.
- **Tempo matches the task.** Calm during prep; short and urgent during a fast sauté.
- **Warn before, not after.** Flag what can go wrong with a recovery path, before it happens.
- **Never use "simply" or "just"** for things that aren't simple.
- **Australian English throughout.** Colour not color. Capsicum. Coriander. Grill not broil.

## How Claude should behave in this project

Claude works as an integrated team — **app developer, UX researcher, ergonomics-focused design psychologist, and kitchen-aware interaction designer — all in one response.**

- **Explain the underlying reason, always.** Not just *what*, but *why*.
- **No propaganda, no marketing speak.** Plain language. Tradeoffs get named.
- **Push back when warranted.** Disagree if a suggestion breaks a golden rule. Kindly but clearly.
- **Show, don't describe.** Build prototypes over writing specs.
- **Leave a testable checkpoint after every non-trivial change.**
- **Play-Store-minded by default.** Material 3, Android gesture navigation, accessibility, data-safety declarations.

## Decisions locked

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| App name | Hone | |
| Stack | Expo + TypeScript + expo-router + NativeWind | Play Store timeline, single codebase for PWA + native |
| Delivery order | PWA first (Cloudflare Pages), native Android second | Instant phone testing |
| Data | Markdown authoring → SQLite runtime, Zod schema validation | |
| Voice input | **Dropped** | Unreliable in kitchen, mic permission friction |
| Cook mode navigation | Standard tap/swipe — knuckle-tap dropped | Patrick's call |
| Monetization | Free, no ads ever | Pro tier = unlimited pantry-to-recipe generation |
| Photos | 10 hand-shot chef-inspired launch recipes. No AI photos ever | |
| Min SDK | Android 8.0 (API 26) | |
| Measurements | Metric only (grams, mL, °C) | Australian audience |
| Ingredient language | Australian English (capsicum, coriander, etc.) | |
| Recipe sourcing | Andy Cooks, Joshua Weissman, Gordon Ramsay (attributed, inspired) | |
| Whole-food rule | No preservatives in any recipe | Non-negotiable product position |

## Testing pipeline

```
Claude makes a change
    ↓
PWA on Cloudflare Pages updates → Patrick refreshes on phone (30-second loop)
    ↓  (weekly or at milestones)
EAS preview build → .apk installed on phone → native feel, haptics, gestures
    ↓  (when feature-complete)
Play Store internal track → Patrick only
    ↓
Play Store open/closed testing
    ↓
Production release
```

## What Patrick must do personally (cannot be delegated)

1. **Google Play Console** — $25 one-time at play.google.com/console. 1–2 weeks identity verification. Start now — this is the long pole.
2. **Expo/EAS account** — free at expo.dev. Tell Claude the username when done.
3. **GitHub** — account is `patrickpatches`.

## Recipe data format

Each recipe is a single structured object:

- `title`, `description`, `base_servings`
- `source`: `{ chef, video_url, notes }` — attribution mandatory for chef-inspired recipes
- `ingredients[]`: each with `id`, `name`, `amount`, `unit`, `scales: "linear" | "fixed" | "custom"`, `substitutions[]`
- `steps[]`: each with `id`, `title`, `content`, `timer_seconds`, `photo_url`, `why_note`
- `leftover_mode`: scaling for planned leftovers
- `categories[]`: array of both cuisine and type tags
- `whole_food_verified: true` — flag confirming no preservatives used

## Android / Play Store specifics (v1)

- **One-handed thumb zone.** Primary actions in the bottom third. Never "Next step" at the top.
- **Dark mode default in cook mode.** OLED-friendly true blacks.
- **Wake lock in cook mode.** Screen stays on while recipe is active.
- **Haptics for confirmations.**
- **Offline-first.** A recipe in progress must never fail on dropped connection.
- **Accessibility.** Text scaling to 200%, TalkBack labels, sufficient contrast in both themes.

## Kill feature (designed, not yet built)

**Pantry → recipe in two stages:**
- Stage 1 — client-side ingredient-match scoring against recipe library (free, instant, offline)
- Stage 2 — "invent me something" → Cloudflare Worker → Claude API → structured recipe in a named chef's style, with explicit disclaimer

Design doc: `docs/pantry-to-recipe.md`

## What NOT to do

- Don't add features before the core loop works (pick → gather → prep → cook → plate).
- Don't use US-centric measurements, ingredient names, or seasonal assumptions.
- Don't label any recipe as Israeli.
- Don't include preservatives, processed shortcuts, or packaged seasoning mixes in recipes.
- Don't adopt stock recipe-app patterns (endless feeds, "likes", calorie shaming) without justification.
- Don't scrape recipes without attribution. Ever.
- Don't write food-blog prose.
- Don't ship untested on actual device.
- Don't use AI-generated food photos.
- Don't reintroduce voice input without Patrick explicitly asking.
- Don't reintroduce knuckle-tap cook mode without Patrick explicitly asking.

## Current status (updated 2026-04-24, session 11)

- **Target launch:** ~June 2026. Play Console verification ✅ COMPLETE (confirmed 2026-04-23).
- **Live prototype:** `hone.html` at project root — single-file React + Tailwind, **45 recipes**, core loop + dual-axis categories + Phase 4 shopping list. Deployed to GitHub Pages as `index.html`. Both files are always kept in sync.
- **Phase 3 ✅:** Recipe library expanded to 44 recipes. All cuisines represented. Attribution on every recipe.
- **Phase 4 ✅:** Shopping list grouped by aisle (Produce/Meat & Seafood/Dairy & Eggs/Bakery/Pantry), Australian hard-to-find ingredient tips, Web Share API export with clipboard fallback.
- **Expo scaffold:** `mobile/` — Expo SDK 54, TypeScript, expo-router, NativeWind, expo-sqlite. Has 44 recipes + Patrick's tortilla in seed-recipes.ts. Behind the HTML prototype on UI features.
- **Archived:** `docs/archive/meal-master.html`
- **ADRs:** `docs/adr/` — stack (001), delivery (002)
- **Phase 5 ✅:** Substitutions UI live. Tap the swap icon on any ingredient → bottom sheet shows pre-baked swaps with Good swap / Compromise badge. 35 substitutions across 10 recipes. Non-covered ingredients show an honest "no swaps on file yet" state.
- **Phase 6 ✅:** Cook mode live. "Start cooking" enters a full-screen OLED overlay (#000000), one step at a time. Wake lock keeps screen on. navigator.vibrate(10) haptic on each "Done" tap. Step counter progress bar at top. 96px ghosted step number watermark. Chef's note expandable. ← Prev / Done → navigation. Auto-jumps to first incomplete step. "Finish" on last step exits cook mode.
- **Phase 7 ✅:** Pantry feature live. New "Pantry" tab in bottom nav (recipe matching only — AI invention removed). Ingredient tag input (type + Enter = chip, Backspace removes last). Quick-add staple buttons (scrollable strip). SYNONYMS + normIng() + inPantry() + scoreRecipe() match against all 44 recipes — "Can make" (≥80% core ings) and "Almost there" (≥35%, ≤3 missing) sections with % badges and missing ingredient chips.
- **UX fixes (session 5) ✅:** (1) Swap sheet is now compact + immediate; (2) Swap button dims to 28% opacity for zero-sub ingredients; (3) Back button returns to correct tab; (4) Cook mode step photos via `stepImg` — live on smash burger, carbonara, butter chicken.
- **Session 6 ✅ — Swap sheet fix + SUBS_DB + shopping list swaps:** Swap sheet `position:fixed` bug fixed. `SUBS_DB` added (60+ substitutions). Shopping list swap button on every item.
- **Session 7 ✅ — Chef URL audit + Patrick's tortilla recipe:** (1) 10 chef attribution URLs corrected across `index.html` and `mobile/src/data/seed-recipes.ts` — fake/wrong YouTube handles replaced with verified real URLs (see list below). (2) Patrick Nasr's flour tortilla recipe added as recipe #45 — tagged Mexican + Baking, credited to Patrick Nasr (not Hone Kitchen). All his techniques preserved: protein flour requirement, hydration warning, 45-min rest, three-flip puff, pot-and-towel finish.
- **Chef URL fixes (session 7):** @Parts-Unknown → @AnthonyBourdainPartsUnknown; @jacquespepin → youtube.com/c/HomeCookingwithJacquesPepin; @thomaskeller → @ChefThomasKeller; @DonnaHayTV → @donnahayonline; @reemkassis → reemkassis.com (no YT channel); @anissahelou → anissas.com (no YT channel); @TartineBread → tartinebakery.com/about (no YT channel); @IvanRamen → ivanramen.com (no YT channel); @MadhurJaffrey → thehappyfoodie.co.uk/chefs/madhur-jaffrey/ (no YT channel); @MarcellaCooking → giulianohazan.com (Marcella died 2013, no channel ever existed).
- **ATO record-keeping:** `Hone_Development_Log_FY2025-26.xlsx` in project root — 3-sheet workbook (Development Log with dated entries, Expense Tracker, Summary with ATO rules). Keep this updated for R&D tax incentive and ABN substantiation.
- **Session 8 ✅ — Expo app brought to feature parity with HTML prototype:**
  - (1) Home screen filters fully wired — All/Quick (≤30 min)/Weekend (≥90 min or Involved)/Favourites/Yours chips are live. Dual-axis cuisine + type category scrollers added below mood chips. "Clear filters" button appears when any filter is active.
  - (2) Step photos rendered in recipe detail — `step.photo_url` images now shown above each step card (both browse and cook mode). `overflow: hidden` on card so photo bleeds edge-to-edge.
  - (3) Add Recipe form built — full single-column form: title, tagline, emoji, time, servings, difficulty selector, optional description, dynamic ingredient rows (amount/unit/name/prep/fixed toggle), dynamic step rows (title/content/stage note/why note). Saves via `insertRecipe` and navigates to the new recipe detail.
  - (4) Shopping list share button — native `Share.share()` with aisle-grouped plain-text output. Share icon button in shopping list modal header (only shown when list is non-empty).
  - (5) `arrow-down` / `arrow-up` icons added to the Icon component.
  - (6) TypeScript compile: zero errors.
- **Session 9 ✅ — App renamed from Simmer Fresh → Hone:** All code, docs, seed data, HTML prototype, memory files updated. Play Store listing name: "Hone - Recipes & Meal Planning" (30 chars). Android package: `com.patricknasr.hone`. HTML prototype: `hone.html`. ATO spreadsheet: `Hone_Development_Log_FY2025-26.xlsx`. GitHub repo rename + Expo slug update are pending Patrick's manual action (see external checklist).
- **Session 10 ✅ — Four-lens polish pass (chef / developer / marketing / accountant):**
  - **Chef:** Fixed US term ("broiler" → "grill" in French Onion Soup). Fixed tortilla recipe `great_swap` quality values in hone.html.
  - **Developer:** Fixed `sourceUrl: null` crash on Watch button (now renders "Original" label). Renamed localStorage key `sf_pantry` → `hone_pantry`. Fixed SQLite DB filename `simmerfresh.db` → `hone.db` in `_layout.tsx`. Fixed `plan.tsx` share footer. Fixed `SwapSheet.tsx` comment. Updated `recipe/[id].tsx` comment.
  - **Marketing/UX:** Recipe card hero height 168 → 192px. Home tagline → "cook like a chef, every night." Search placeholder improved. Cook mode progress bar 3 → 4px. Step content font 17 → 18px. Star icon replaced with `people` icon for serves. Recipe title added faintly to cook mode top bar. `people` icon added to HTML icon set.
  - **Accountant:** ATO development log updated with 8 new entries (Sessions 8–10). Title updated from "SIMMER FRESH" to "HONE". Project description updated.
  - **Files:** hone.html and index.html
- **Session 11 ✅ — First working Android APK built:**
  - Root cause of all prior build failures: all native packages (gesture-handler, safe-area-context, reanimated, worklets, screens, and all expo-* modules) were versions targeting an older React Native, not SDK 54/RN 0.81.
  - Fix: ran `npx expo install --check` to identify every mismatch, then `npx expo install` to pin all packages to SDK 54 compatible versions. Key upgrades: gesture-handler 2.20 → 2.28, safe-area-context 4.12 → 5.6, worklets 0.8.1 → 0.5.1, expo-router 4 → 6, all expo-* modules bumped to SDK 54 compatible ranges.
  - Build pipeline: GitHub Actions (Ubuntu runner) → `expo prebuild --clean` → `./gradlew assembleDebug`. TypeScript: zero errors after all package upgrades.
  - **APK:** `hone-debug.apk` — 63.7 MB debug build, GitHub Actions run 24873454825. Download from: https://github.com/patrickpatches/hone/actions/runs/24873454825
  - **Next steps:** Install APK on Patrick's phone → test core loop → Play Store assets (icon 512×512, feature graphic, screenshots) → privacy policy → content rating → internal track submission. 
## Session 12 (2026-04-25) — bug audit + OneDrive root-cause fix

**App working on Patrick's phone.** APK from session 11 installs and runs. Patrick reported a series of UX problems and bugs after testing.

**Backlog written:** `docs/session-12-backlog.md` — every reported issue captured with root cause (file + line region), what world-class apps do, recommended fix, conflict analysis with other planned changes, and priority. Read this first before doing any Hone work.

**Issues identified (priority order):**
- P0 Pantry: search and add are two separate inputs that look identical → confusing → unify into one
- P0 Pantry: duplicate ingredients ("Yellow onion" + "Yellow onions" + ~50 others) → synonym map + plural-aware dedup
- P0 Recipe data: ingredients like "Ghee or clarified butter" inline an alternative into the name → audit + move to substitutions[]
- P0 Add-recipe form: rigid, asks user to self-rate difficulty (subjective garbage data), 60+ form fields → rewrite as paste-and-parse
- P1 Add-to-plan flow: should start from RecipeCard / recipe detail, not the Plan tab
- P2 Recipe portions: tortillas/sourdough don't fit "serves N" model → introduce yield-type schema (servings/pieces/loaf/batch). Demands ADR before code.
- P3 Clear-filter button: low-contrast, hidden → promote to coloured chip rail

**File-system housekeeping (this session):**
- Today's snapshot at `docs/archive/backup-2026-04-25/` (CLAUDE.md, hone.html, index.html, all 4 tab screens, recipe detail, seed-recipes, pantry-helpers, types).
- Simmer Fresh rename leftovers archived to `docs/archive/simmer-fresh-rename-leftovers/`.
- Stale Claude Code worktrees in `mobile/.claude/worktrees/` and `mobile/.validate-tmp*` directories could not be deleted via WSL bash (OneDrive ACL blocked rm). Patrick to delete in Windows Explorer. **NOTE:** the `silly-williams-21445f` worktree turned out to be the most recent CLEAN snapshot of the source code — see OneDrive corruption note below. Do NOT delete it until OneDrive is fixed and a fresh clean copy is verified.

**OneDrive corruption — root cause found and documented:**
- `Edit` tool's incremental read-modify-write pattern races with OneDrive's file lock during background sync, producing files with correct byte count but truncated/garbled content past the lock point.
- `Write` tool (full file rewrite) and shell `cp`/`echo`/`python` writes all produce intact files. Tested in session.
- Several source files were already corrupted on disk before this session began — `seed-recipes.ts` truncated mid-string at line 3384, `recipe/[id].tsx` truncated mid-line, `(tabs)/index.tsx` truncated mid-JSX. CLAUDE.md's "TypeScript: zero errors" claim from session 11 was outdated; the corruption happened sometime between sessions 11 and 12.
- Recovered all corrupted files from the stale `mobile/.claude/worktrees/silly-williams-21445f/` worktree (the most recent intact snapshot). Project source code is now back to a clean known-good state matching the working APK.
- **Permanent fix written up at `docs/onedrive-fix.md`.** Two options for Patrick: (A) right-click `Cooking App` folder → "Always keep on this device" (quick), or (B) move project to `C:\Users\patri\Projects\Hone\` and symlink back into OneDrive (cleanest). Until applied, the rule for any future Claude session in this project is: **use Write tool only, never Edit, for source files.**

**Code changes attempted this session that DID NOT survive:**
- Calendar icon added to Icon component
- INGREDIENT_SYNONYMS map + improved normalizeForMatch in pantry-helpers
- Single search-or-add input in pantry.tsx
- Calendar button + onAddToPlan prop on RecipeCard
- Calendar button on recipe detail
- AddToPlanSheet wiring in Kitchen index.tsx and recipe/[id].tsx

All Edit-tool changes above were silently corrupted by OneDrive and rolled back when files were restored. **`mobile/src/components/AddToPlanSheet.tsx` (320 lines, 9.6 KB) DID survive** — written via Write tool, sits orphan in the source tree, ready to wire up next session.

**Next session (Session 13) — first priority:** confirm OneDrive fix is applied (Option A or B from `docs/onedrive-fix.md`), then re-apply the P0 changes using `Write` tool only. The plan and the AddToPlanSheet are already in place; this is implementation, not design.

**Outstanding asks for Patrick:**
- App icon (chef knife + tomato on yellow): drag-drop the actual file into chat in next session, OR save it to `mobile/assets/source-icon.png`. The inline image was visible to me but not accessible as a file in this session.
- Apply OneDrive fix per `docs/onedrive-fix.md`.
- Delete stale worktrees + validate-tmp directories in Windows Explorer (after OneDrive fix and after a fresh clean source backup is taken).

---

## Session 12 (continued, 2026-04-25) — P0 fixes shipped + app icon

After diagnosing the OneDrive corruption (Edit tool unsafe in OneDrive folder), switched to shell-based writes (read original from worktree, modify in `/tmp` via Python, `cp` to project location). Every file written this way was intact on first attempt — confirmed via tail integrity checks.

**Code changes shipped:**
1. **Icon set extended** — `calendar` + `plus-circle` icons added to `Icon.tsx` for the new affordances.
2. **Pantry dedup** — `INGREDIENT_SYNONYMS` map (60+ entries) + `" or X"` suffix stripping in `normalizeForMatch`. "Yellow onion" / "Yellow onions" / "yellow onions, sliced" now collapse to one canonical entry. "Ghee or clarified butter" canonicalises to "ghee" at pantry layer (recipe data audit still in backlog as a separate cleanup).
3. **Pantry single-input UX** — dropped the dual search-and-add inputs. One combined input now drives both filtering AND an inline "+ Add 'X' to your pantry" suggestion that appears when the query doesn't match anything. Plural- and synonym-aware so it never offers to create a duplicate.
4. **Add-to-plan from anywhere** — new `AddToPlanSheet.tsx` (14-day picker, today highlighted, planned-day dot indicator). Wired into:
   - RecipeCard (calendar icon top-right of hero, next to favourite)
   - Recipe detail (calendar CircleButton in top bar between Back and Favourite)
5. **App icon** — generated from `assets/source-icon.png.png` (chef knife + tomato on yellow). All four required outputs at `mobile/assets/`:
   - `icon.png` 1024×1024
   - `adaptive-icon.png` 1024×1024 (subject in 88% safe area)
   - `splash-icon.png` 1024×1024
   - `favicon.png` 48×48
   - `app.json` updated: `android.adaptiveIcon.backgroundColor` set to `#F9C43F` (sampled from icon yellow) so masked-icon edges match the foreground.

**Status of OneDrive fix:** Patrick deferred to later. The shell-write workaround handled this session, but every future session in this folder should:
- Use `Write` tool sparingly (it sometimes works, sometimes corrupts)
- Prefer shell-based writes (`cp` from `/tmp`) for reliability
- Or apply Option A from `docs/onedrive-fix.md` to remove the constraint entirely

**What still needs Patrick:**
- Apply OneDrive fix (Option A or B from `docs/onedrive-fix.md`) — still unresolved.
- Delete stale `mobile/.claude/worktrees/` and `mobile/.validate-tmp*` folders in Windows Explorer. Wait until OneDrive fix is in place first — those worktrees were our recovery source today.
- Build a fresh APK to test the new pantry UX, calendar buttons, and icon. (`expo prebuild --clean && ./gradlew assembleDebug` via the same GitHub Actions pipeline as session 11.)

**Backlog state:** P0 pantry + P0 add-to-plan items are now CODE COMPLETE. Remaining open: P0 recipe data audit ("X or Y" ingredient names — 35 instances catalogued in seed-recipes.ts), P0 add-recipe form rewrite (paste-and-parse), P2 recipe yield model (needs ADR), P3 clear-filter chip rail.

---

## Session 13 (2026-04-25 evening) — UX wave 2: + sign, clear filter, yield types, plan-tab nudge, add-recipe paste mode

Trigger: Patrick installed APK from session 12 build (run #10, hone-release.apk) and reported the same backlog items still present from his POV. Audit confirmed the session-12 fixes ARE in `b329bc4` on git HEAD, but Patrick had specific UX requests that went beyond what session 12 shipped:

- "+" icon for Add-to-plan affordance — not the more subtle calendar icon
- Clear filter button is too low contrast — promote to coloured chip rail
- Recipe portions break for yield-by-count items (tortillas, dumplings, etc) and yield-by-loaf (sourdough)
- Add-recipe form is too rigid — needs paste-and-parse mode

Backup: `docs/archive/backup-2026-04-25-evening/` — pre-change snapshot.
