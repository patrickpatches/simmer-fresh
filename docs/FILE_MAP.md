## Root level — only permanent project fixtures live here

| File / Folder | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Single source of truth: project rules, product vision, document control. Every session reads this first. |
| `BUGS.md` | Open bug tracker. Synced from GitHub Issues at session start. Never self-close bugs — Patrick validates on-device. |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Shipped version history. Keep a Changelog format, semver from 1.0. |
| `README.md` | Public-facing repo intro: stack, rules, build instructions, doc index. |
| `index.html` | The deployed PWA — web export of the Hone app. Copied to `_site/` by the Pages workflow. Do not move. |
| `mobile/` | The entire Expo / React Native app. All app code lives here. |
| `docs/` | All project documentation. See below. |
| `scripts/` | Developer utility scripts (bat, sh). Not app code. |
| `.github/workflows/` | CI/CD: Android APK build + GitHub Pages deploy. |

## Naming conventions

- **Session reports:** `Hone_Session_Report_DD_Month_YYYY.md` → `docs/sessions/`. For a second (or third) session on the same day, append a sequential number: `_2.md`, `_3.md`. **Never** append a role tag (`_COO`, `_engineer`, etc.) — discoverable content lives in the H1 title and summary inside the file, not the filename.
- **ADRs:** `NNN-kebab-title.md` → `docs/adr/`
- **Specialist briefs:** `<role-name>.md` → `docs/coo/specialists/`
- **Decision log entries:** `DECISION-NNN` numbered, all in `docs/coo/decision-log.md` (one file, newest at top)
- **Risk register entries:** `R-NNN` numbered, all in `docs/coo/risk-register.md` (one file)
- **Backups created during a risky refactor:** `backup-YYYY-MM-DD[-descriptor]/` → `d
