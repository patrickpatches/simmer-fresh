## Phase 1 — Live PWA on your phone
**Goal:** Patrick can open a URL on his Android phone and test the app after every change.  
**Delivery:** GitHub Pages (patrickpatches account, no new accounts needed)  
**Effort:** ~1–2 hours

- ✅ hone.html prototype (30 recipes, dual-axis categories, core loop)

- ✅ Deploy to GitHub Pages → `patrickpatches.github.io/hone`
- ⬜ Verify it loads and is usable on Android Chrome

## Phase 2 — Data foundation (substitutions schema)
**Goal:** Every ingredient in every recipe has a `substitutions[]` array. This is the foundation for the shopping list, ingredient swaps, and the future pantry feature.  
**Effort:** ~1 session

- ✅ Update Zod schema in `mobile/src/data/types.ts` — added `CuisineId`, `TypeId`, `SwapQuality`, `Substitution` types + `substitutions[]` on Ingredient
- ✅ Added `categories` (cuisines + types dual-axis) and `whole_food_verified` to Recipe schema with refine validation
- ✅ All 28 seed recipes updated with correct categories and `whole_food_verified: true`
- ✅ Full substitution data on SMASH_BURGER (6 ingredients, 13 swaps), PASTA_CARBONARA (3 ingredients, 6 swaps), MUSAKHAN (3 ingredients, 7 swaps)
- ✅ TypeScript check passes — 0 errors
- ✅ Fixed pre-existing package.json truncation bug

**Effort:** 1 session

- ⬜ Triggered by tapping ingredient
- ⬜ Shows: alternative ingredient, what changes (flavour/texture/appearance), good swap or compromise rating

---

## Phase 6 — Cook mode
**Goal:** Full-screen step-by-step cook experience. Dark mode. Screen stays on. Haptics on step advance.
